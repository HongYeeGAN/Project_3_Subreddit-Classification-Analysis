It’s time for PlayStation Studios to try new things for PS5,GoGoGadgetGabe,"Okay so this post is to essentially call out PlayStation Studios on trying new genres. We keep getting the same 3rd person action games from them, they work to a certain extent but in the end all feel the same in some shape or form.

-Days Gone
-Uncharted
-The Last of Us
-Ghost of Tsushima
-God of War

All 3rd person action titles with cinematic story telling, its great and we know it’s what PlayStation Studios is good at but I’d love to see them try maybe an FPS, or a western rpg, hell even a JRPG (Sucker Punch has proven they can develop a Japanese title), fighting game, racing or kart racing, platformer, etc.

We’re off to a great start with Sackboy and Destruction Allstars. I just want them all to broaden their horizons a bit. Thoughts?",0,0.23,22,2020-09-28 16:42:58
Question about 3 PS5 systems and account sharing.,aka_r4mses,"I will be getting 3 PS5’s, 1 for me and 2 for the kids.  Right now I have 2 PS4’s and the kids have their own accounts on one and they share my digital games I purchase from mine.  Now, since I am adding another system with the PS5 I’m wondering how this will work.  Would I be able to share my digital purchases on three consoles?  If so could all three be online at the same time (different user accounts of course)?  I’m just trying to plan ahead and know how I want to set these up.  It would be great if I could continue to just buy a game one time and share it, as well as all three of us be online at the same time.

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),iHelghan,"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.
Sorry for any grammar mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,CasketGymnastics,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",6,0.67,16,2020-09-28 13:15:08

Game boost mode for ps4 games,densetsu86,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

Yes Demons Soul Does Have Ray Tracing At 1440p 60Fps,Krios625," [Based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiqGi3GMTko&amp;has_verified=1)  on the gameplay trailer alone since you don't need DF to have eyes. Now if you want to argue what type of RT it is fine, but it clearly has RT. Examples

1. At 1:03 the little puddle is clearly Ray Traced
2. AT 1:36 the other small puddle is Ray Traced
3. At 1:50 Repeat with puddle
4. At 2:20 the armor reflects the bonfire light next to it

If they revived an old favorite via sequel or remake for the new generation of consoles what would titles would get you genuinely excited?,jruff84,"I absolutely love video games and although I would never really call myself a hard-core gamer, especially after having kids and very little time to devote to the hobby, I’ve been around long enough to have my fair share of memorable video game moments.  

The soul crushing experience of beating Ghouls &amp; Ghosts only to find it demanding a second play through to officially beat the game...  Neighborhood friends leaning on my windowsill, mouth agape when we discovered the blood code for Mortal Kombat. My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I’m a dad and don’t have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there’s just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can’t honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn’t quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of “live ammunition“, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn’t want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn’t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that’s what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn’t even have to like golf to enjoy those games. 

Wipeout - I mean come on this game is PlayStation. Nough said.

Twisted metal - “Ehem” See above.

New studio acquisitions,Mockzer0,"With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response. When I think about it, I would hope that if Sony has money stashed away for these type of acquisitions it would be better spent on creating new studios.
First off, a new studio would cost significantly less than buying established IP. Some of them are outlandish propositions people were putting out would have Sony buying Square Enix (valued around 6.8 billion) and even ubisoft (valued at 10.5 billion). Even if you consider a more realistic acquisition like From Soft(which is tied up under a much larger parent company) or Platinum, you are still talking about very expensive deals.
You could build new mid-sized (70 people) studios for approximately $25 - 35 million (salary + overhead) for the three to four years they would need to start self sustaining with revenue.
What if they started four of them!
They would come with the benefit of creating even more diversity that we would get to play.
I would be far less excited for them to buy an existing studio that already was planning on putting their games on PlayStation.
Just my two cents, but when I thought about that 7.5 billion dollar number, I immediately started thinking about how many new studios Microsoft could have created instead.",0,0.25,73,2020-09-27 23:16:46

Clearing up PS5 confusions,Khannibal-Lecter,"1. The PS5 SSD is not that special the component that makes the SSD special is the IO complex. For example this IO complex is responsible for decompression which frees the CPU to process gameplay data. 

2. 99% of PS4 games will work on PS5 via backwards compatibility. This means if you insert your PS4 Spider-Man copy or download your digital PS4 copy you will be able to play it from day one. 

3. Spider-Man that comes with Miles Morales is a Remaster and this is completely different than increasing few settings in a options menu. This remaster includes ray tracing, new assets, increased city density and it took many developers time and effort. 

4. PS4 controller DualShock 4 is only able to play PS4 games on PS5. The reason why we are not able to play PS5 only games with DualShock 4 is that the PS5 only games are designed to fully utilise the DualSense controller that includes gameplay functions.",58,0.63,135,2020-09-27 22:54:18

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,Aclysmic,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is.

I also think how Man Of Medan was and hopefully the sequel Little Hope that they could make a VR game or maybe the third installment be VR.,3,0.57,7,2020-09-27 10:50:12

"I'm very sentimental towards my PSN account, but is it really worth keeping for when PS5 comes out?",GoldnDiesel,"Sounds an odd question, why not just keep it? Well to be honest I've been tempted for a long time to start fresh and I think this would be a good time to do so. My current account is loaded with way too many friends on my list that I no longer play with, I can get myself a new PSN name for free (already changed it once and didn't like what I chose)

I used to care about Trophies but I haven't bothered due to lack of time to play the game now, that was a main reason I was wanting to keep it around. That said I'm assuming everything restarts fresh with new Trophies etc when PS5 comes out? 

I don't know if anyone else is considering this and maybe your someone who isn't bothered with keeping an account that's over 10 years old, but for me it's a tough decision but I think I might just start fresh.

Disappointing UK/PAL Box Art News: PS5 to KEEP the PS4 plain white text spine art for Sony games,MitchyPower,"When we got box art for Miles Morales in PAL territories, we saw that it had a logo on the side, something that almost never happens for Sony first party pal games... Apart from Spiderman. It led many of us to hope that this would carry over to all next gen first party titles. We had also theorised that perhaps it was just for Spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's, as it appeared to be replicating the box art too.

Unfortunately, that is not the case (pun not intended). The box art for Sackboy has been revealed, and it has the cursed plain white text on it's spine

If you are wondering the meaning of this, [I made a more detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/) about this back when we got that news, complete with pics for non-PAL readers

But I'll give you a brief summary

* If you buy a PAL First party sony game, you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box. This alone wouldn't be a problem, as the PS2 in Europe had it, and it's quite aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that it is ONLY Sony games with this, instead of everyone like for the PS2. This leaves your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of games, and pirated movies you bought in a foreign country on your vacation.

I was personally holding out hope for some change this generation, but it looks like I am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality

This is especially disappointing, as Sony promised a more global approach this generation, but this notion seems to have been just PR speak.

FAQs

&gt;I like the plain text on the PS2!

As do I, but it needs to be all or nothing. All logos, or all plain, it makes some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone

&gt;Why do you care so much?

As a physical owner, I like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's I've sunk many hours into. 99.99% of the time, I will finish a game, and then it will sit on the shelf. Is it that wrong to care for how a display piece looks?

&gt;Just use the alternate cover!

I would... if we got those. Most PAL territories get health warnings on the inside cover instead of the reversible covers found on Spiderman and God of War

&gt;Just Print out the US one!

Also not an option, as Sony doesn't put these scans up for Piracy reasons, meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan, which are far from a good quality. Or you have to import an empty case, which starts to stack up as a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party games

&gt;First World problem much?

You're right, but Gaming is a first world pastime. If I am spending as much as I am on a game, it's not unreasonable to have packaging that looks good.

&gt;OCD?

No, just have a shelf, like that shelf, want to have some consistency in the games on that shelf",0,0.39,9,2020-09-27 05:53:37

Waiting at 5AM until 12PM to get my PS5 secured at GameStop was honestly one of the most fun and memorable experiences I’ve ever had. And here are my tips if you ever decide to camp out for one.,OxEagle19,"As the title says, I’ve managed to secure a pre order at my GameStop to get my PS5, and I still can’t believe it honestly. Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",667,0.82,288,2020-09-27 05:16:02
What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,thechickenskull,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",127,0.86,160,2020-09-27 04:57:26
Sony should make PS5 UI like their phone UI. Customizable home screen and app drawer.,youriqis20pointslow,"PS4's current UI is a disaster, especially if you have a lot of games.

Who else wishes for Sony to have diverse genre of games instead of just story driven third person games?,solicited_nuke,"As great the story driven games of PS4 are, I wish there were more variety in first party lineup. The games are getting more samey and I am sure I'd eventually get bored of them just like I got bored of Assassins Creed Series and Gears series.

There are no first party multiplayer heavy FPS game, similar to Halo. 

No RPG like BOTW. The only good open world first person RPG Elder Scrolls is supposedly not coming to PS5 and Avowed is the only game that seems to be falling under the same category, which is also again not coming to PS5.

There are no first party arcade racers or cart racers like Forza Horizon or Mario Kart.

 There are no 2D platforming like Ori or Donkey Kong. 

No turn based strategy game like Mario Rabbid or Gears Tactics. 

No game to play and chill with friends, similar to Animals Crossing or Sea Of Thieves.

 No fighting game like Smash Bros or Killer Instinct.

 No RTS like Halo Wars or AoE. 

I might have missed some as well. 

I own every hit PS4 exclusive but I have only played them once. I wish we had more genre of games with more replayability and variety. With new gen of games getting even more expensive, I just wish we had more replayability.

Sony Gathering Information About PSVR and Gaming Habits,FN2187theTr-8r,"I got a lengthy survey from Sony today that took about 10 minutes.
Basically, they were asking me my thoughts on VR, if I owned a PSVR, if I still play it, and why/why not.

They also asked 'What is the most important: gaming on a dedicated device, or being able to play games across multiple devices.'

Very interesting. Could Sony be thinking about opening game streaming to phones like Microsoft is doing? Or perhaps the next PSVR will be open and let you use it with other devices (phones, computers, tablets, etc)?

What are your thoughts?

"Sony's PS5 ""Gamer Feel"" + Wipeout 4, Motorstorm, Knack 3, The Order?",backupaccount12411,"**From** PS1 to PS4, Sony have been there for us as gamers. From the feel-good moments  (""$299!"") &amp; the success taking on the Nintendo 64 &amp; Sega Saturn Juggernauts, Sony started strong.

By the time the PS3 had really hit its stride, with fantastic first party studio acquisitions and partnerships like Naughty Dog, From Software, and Media Molecule, I've always felt that despite owning multiple consoles &amp; PCs, Sony earnt my loyalty.

There have been some tough moments on PS4 (lacking wishlists, playtime, easy internal media storage, and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our PS1/PS2 collections, among others) but we've always been able to count on Sony to treat us like gamers and not insult the value of our time, bringing us first-party experiences like no other, and sharing it with PC &amp; other console brethren when possible. **So thank you Sony**, for bringing up welling excitement with the PS5 like never  before.

**To the point of this post**. There are a few franchises which are difficult to imagine life without, however it feels like too long already. Sony, can you bring us these, in some form or another? Or will they forever languish, lost to competing interests or past memories?

\-**Wipeout Series**. On all Sony consoles, there has been that reliable ultra-fast anti-grav racing experience. The thrill of modern hard electronica thudding through our brains, whilst the blood heats in our veins, has been a fantastic thing to enjoy since the one I began with, Wipeout 2097 (XL for NTSC partiers). It furthered a lifelong love of sensory overload and thumping breaks/d&amp;b. Will it come to PS5? Every month without an announcement is torturous, and surely others feel the same.

\-**Motorstorm Series**. More metal &amp; grunge than anything, and channelling Road Rash, Twisted Metal, and Carmageddon all at the same time, again with the aural overload that brings home the bass. As an Aussie, the locales often dug deep into that need to explore the unknown, and one misses it every day since a very first 720p game on the Fat PS3.

\-**Knack 3**. As someone who likes to look nothing up about games before immersing myself in the world, and after finishing the first knack with a partner, and finally getting around to the second most recently, it was very surprising to learn that the first was moderately well-received, and the second just so slightly more. No other game series, as someone who grew up in the '90s, has been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement as an adult. 

**Knack 1 &amp; 2 were** **that** **feeling** of waking up at 5 am, sneaking into the TV room with a blanket, and watching Saturday morning cartoons - but this time, as an adult, with a significant other! That feeling is priceless, in a world where many have lost their ""wonder &amp; magic"" feelings to the prey of a quick, endlessly unsatisfying slot machine-type loop. 

\-**The Order: 1886**. This was a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that I've witnessed. The story was gripping, the combat was thrilling, and of course, there was no sequel or mention, after the mediocre reviews ripped it apart for being ""boring, unambitious, not next-gen, a glorified walking simulator"". I am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wings (or perhaps the figurative wings it has been given are the wrong ones?).

\-**PT.** Please. Make it so. The masses have spoken.

So, In conclusion to this essay-length feature, for anyone that made it this far, is a request to SIE to keep valuing our intelligence, and especially those of us that don't have the money but spend it anyway, because we continue to trust in your expertise as gamers and successful innovators.

And to developers that work with Sony: keep producing wonderful works. Resist the temptation to fall prey to companies who have a history of buying and running talented studios into the ground. Push back when the execs tell you that it's not a winning proposition, despite the rich history and worlds you've built. Don't take the easy monetization route, or one that compromises your ability to reach us Single-player experience-based gamers, because in this day and age, when some of us desperately need another world to be transported away to, we don't want to worry whether that world will be there for us in the future. There's enough of that already in real life.",3,0.56,19,2020-09-26 15:22:49

Tempest and 360 reality audio,JonTheWong,"I’m looking for a headset to replace my BT JBL headset that I use for PS4 wired and on my many other devices. 

I have my eye on the Sony WH1000xm4/b

https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4

They list 360 reality audio on a chipset and the PS has the tempest engine chipset so I was wondering how compatible would it/could it be?

Based on PS5 wireless chipset they support BT 5.1 and ideally will support BT headsets but I’m ok with wired. 

My long winded question is; would this be a good choice?

I’m not interested in having two headsets hence why i don’t have the gold/platinum ps4 ones.

I’m open to another brand but ideally I’d like to take advantage of the 3D sound for warzone 😝

What kind of game is missing from Sony’s first party lineup of games?,DigiQuip,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the games Sony has in the oven ready to go over the next few years. They have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchises and I don’t think there’s a lot of worry about whether the PS5 will struggle to find enough titles that by themselves will sell consoles. But where’s their weakness? What genre is leaving the biggest hole in Sony Studios first party lineup?

There are a few areas I think Sony could stand to invest in. First, is a military shooter. Maybe not first person, but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential. I’m sure the Crist thought goes right to SOCOM, as it should. People have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it’s for good reason. SOCOM was a tight, tactical shooter that gave many players their first taste of online multiplayer. It would do well with a reboot and could solidify the PS5 as the complete console package. 

The second area Sony should look into is a bit ambitious. But a 100+ hour open world game like The Witcher or Red Dead or even Assassin’s Creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play. What I mean by this is a huge open world game that keeps players invested in the world and experiences long after the main story is complete. Sony has explored open world style games with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and most recently with Ghost of Tushima. This has extra implication because Xbox has the Bethesda, the undisputed king of making open world epics. 

Finally, Sony needs a sci-fi game. I don’t really know where on the spectrum of sci-s game needs to fall but with Killzone on the shelf collecting dust something needs to take its place. An argument could be made that Horizon meets the sci-fi criteria but I’m looking more in the realm of aliens, space ships, and energy weapons. It’s a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it has lasting potential in the world of gaming. I think Sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of consoles.",2,0.55,65,2020-09-26 09:55:06

The expensive dollar to reals right now and the overall economy makes it pretty difficult to buy stuff off my US account. I'd love to finally be able to buy stuff on my own currency.

Before anyone tell me to just create a new account I really don't want to. I have a whole life with my main US account, loads of games and DLCs, thousand of trophies and more than 100 friends.

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,talhindi416,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles. For example, both consoles got **themes and background customization support** a lot further down the road. (I always found it weird that even though themes were very much a  thing on PS3, they weren't a thing on PS4 at all until I think about a year into the console's life.

PS4, specifically, got the following features and some others that I'm probably forgetting about a number of years after the console launched: **(folders, quick menu support, online/offline appearance, etc.)**

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays. But going off of their track record, I am just concerned we'll be missing a lot of these cool features come November 12th. Keep in mind, I have no idea of the complexities of UI development and don't want to undermine the hard work I'm sure they're putting into the UI.

"I don't like the idea of Sony buying, konami, capcom or square enix, or any other big publisher.",ronbeef1kg20pesos,"I have a few  opinions that i want to talk about, hope this post doesn't get deleted

I think nurturing studios is the good way, the way sony did so far,  what microsoft did is just throw money at zenimax and that's it. Is funny how Microsoft hasn't even talked about games that much, all of their doing so far is litetally just throwing money with cheap gamepass service and buying a big publisher.

What i want to say with this is, Sony so far has shown more games (let the games do the talking) and a lot of users seems to forget that the most important part of a service or games  is to have good things to go for, i know gamepass has good games but honestly i don't think all worth paying a monthly fee, a lot are praising gamepass, praising microsoft buying zenimax, which in my mind is bad for all of us, on top of this, MS still hasn't showed or proved that their are going to have a good line up so far.
I know you may say ""but they bought several good team developers by buying zenimax"" well that's true, but we still have not seen any in regards of this, no games, no nada yet.

I think Sony still have a very solid games lineup, strong enough to convince anyone to have a ps5, just don't forget that games are what important most of anything else in this business.

Edit:

some more thoughts

I think MS is not competing, they want to take over the market with brute force (aka money)

Something that im questioning my self too

What would avoid MS to buy a lot more third party publishers, like take two or ea, or ubisoft, in lets say 5-7 years?
It will not be fair to us users having MS locking all of the third party gaming publishers for the sake of ""being competitive""

If i had money to spare i would be beting that this is how microsoft is going to compete from now on until they get most of the share of the market and then to fully become a monopoly, if they succeed.

A Case for Remakes.,GMoneyChuck89,"I don't know if I am in the minority here, but I am loving this new boom of video game remakes. Sure, it can be seen as lazy to just give an old game a new can of paint and sell it off to us for nostalgia reasons, but I'm actually excited about that.

As a movie buff, I am always interested in remakes, seeing how a different director puts his vision into a known project. I guess the same thing pertains to games. I want to see how my old favorites would look with modern graphics. Plus, with recent remakes, they feel like entirely new games (FF7 remake), despite being the same subject material.

So, are there any old games you'd love to see remade? I'd love to see Dead Space make a return.

Unanswered questions regarding the Playstation 5,Aratrax,"I apologize for my bad english.   
This  is not about anwering my ""questions"" but more about the fact that many things are still unknown. All these things can change the opinion on the Playstation 5 drastically. 

The PS5 release date and price are finally public (or atleast for more than a week). Some people were lucky enough and managed to pre-order a Playstation 5 and many people were not. I was lucky enough and managed to grab a launch day PS5 Disk Preorder. Since that day I've been unpatiently counting down the days 'till I can get my hands on that beautiful piece of tech.

And yet there are some questions that are floating in my mind.

**What is the noise level of the Playstation 5?**The Playstation 4 was known for its bad cooling system and loud fans and I'm worried that the PS5 will be the continuation of this story. Sony already announced that they invested a huge amount of money into the development of a good cooling solution but there is always a fine line between marketing babble and facts. I for my part did not own a PS4 (I switched to PC) and can't judge it for myself but I'm still worried.

**Why is sony still so vague about backwards compability?**I know, I know... Sony already announced that many games PS4 games will be playable on the PS5 but I'm still wondering how PS5 digital users will be able to do so. Sony is still really vague and I'm worried that there will be on or another catch. Microsoft really did a good job and made everything quite clear.I'm still hoping that sony will do the same. I really can't wait on getting my hands on all those great PS4 games that I missed out on. (Yes. I will definitely make use of the PS plus collection)

**What will the UI look like?**Up until now we were only able to get a short glimpse at the new Playstation 5 UI. I'm really looking forward on getting more footage of the UI.

**What's with Background Applications like Discord, or Teamspeak?**It wasn't possible with the Playstation 4 but maybe with the 5. I really would like to be able to talk to my PC or Xbox friends while I'm playing on my PS5 without leaving my computer on. This feature would really improve the whole gaming experience.

**Will we ever get a black PS5 oder atleast good Playstation 5 skins?**The opinions on the Playstation 5 design vary quite a lot and range from ""I love it"" to ""It's fcking disgusting"". The design of consoles or rather more everything is always a highly subjective matter but still... Sony made a high risk choice. The Playstation 5 design really stands out and some or not many people would appreciate the ability to get  rid  of the white colour. I am really hoping for a black PS5.Thankfully Dbrand already announced their skin line-up for the Playstation 5.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these questions above won't change the fact that we all will have a lot of fun the Playstation 5. All  of these announced Playstation 5 games sound highly promising and I can't wait to play them all. (RIP wallet)",0,0.41,41,2020-09-25 23:07:16

Will disk-based PS5 games require a full-copy/install to play?,coreysnyder04,"Update: This is 100% the case. I didn't realize PS4 already does this so fully expect this to continue. 

Has Sony talked about how they plan to handle disk-based games and game installs? This new PS5 SSD technology doesn't really apply if the system has to try to read the data from the disk, which I'd guess is many factors slower than SSD read speeds. I imagine it wouldn't need to copy over certain things, like menus and other data that doesn't need to be read as quickly. But those make up a small portion of the actual game data.

What I could totally see them doing is: You pop the disk in, and it has to copy over nearly the entire game over to the SSD for gameplay. I REALLY hope this isn't the case. The reason I bought the disk-based console is to mitigate the issue that my HD is constantly full from downloading games/updates. If the console requires copying over disk-based games, that benefit goes out the window. I would still get the benefit that copying from disk is still faster than download speeds if I want to delete and later reinstall the game.

Thoughts?

I know that specs don't matter but PS5 is way closer than people think to the Series X on every level,Krios625,"1. The CPU conundrum and why many seem to misunderstand it. While *fixed clocked speeds seem inherently better than variable frequencies, they are much harder to cool since the system needs to be ready for a worse case scenario at all times and use up more power needlessly.* There's a reason why every major semiconductor has ditched fixed clock speeds for more than 5 years and it's the reason the PS4 seemed loud as heck (lack of culling) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/fujtke/purpose_of_variable_frequencies/) thread sums the this point better if interested but that's the basic idea why PS5 went for Smartshift vs going for a fixed frequency.
2. GPU: Same point about the variable clock speeds vs fixed. The biggest difference to me here is the amount of CU's the Series X has for RT performance vs  the PS5 not the Tflops.  80 bil ray/s x 208 RT cores (52 x 4 TMU's per CU's in RDNA2 and each TMU has 1 RT Core in RDNA2) x 1825 mhz divided by the industry standard 10 deep BVH and the result is roughly 38 Giga rays/s , so it will have way better performance on that front. Now the PS5 GPU has more fill rate, internal GPU bandwidth and faster triangle set-up so it's not a knockout just because Youtubers tell u 12 vs 10,2 Tflops.
3. Ram: The biggest problem for the Series X imo. While it's 10 GB's of Vram are **insanely fast** (can't stress that enough) it's simply not enough for some games at 4K, we're seeing that now with the 3080 and just how much lack of Vram can hurt. Problem number 2 is that it's segmented unlike the PS5's unified 16 GB running at 448 GB/s. The Series X also uses half a gig of ram more than the PS5 for the OS but that's nothing crazy.
4. SSD: Short and sweet since this isn't much of a battle. The Series X in theory can do a maximum of 6GB/s compressed which thanks to bottle necks is closer to 3GB/S real life performance. PS5 can go to up to 22 GB/S thanks to the IO coprocessors, crazy SSD and Kraken Decompression unit meaning in real performance that games can load in about 2 -3 seconds flat.

Conclusion: The PS5 was designed to be as easy to develop for as humanely possible (which was clear after the Road to PS5) since it doesn't have any major bottlenecks as a system and while not offering the same beefy performance as the Series X it does make it's power easier to access to devs so I don't think anyone should expect major if any differences on 3rd party multiplats. Hope this helps, but please feel free to disagree and correct me if you disagree with this post",0,0.45,92,2020-09-25 13:33:16

Idea for a new Castlevania game,ktsmith91,"This is my own personal opinion on how to make a new one and how to do it right. To be clear, this is a 3D Castlevania game.

- Dark Souls/Bloodborne inspired with a focus on the checkpoint to checkpoint style gameplay
- Game is meant to be difficult but fair *(just like Dark Souls and the Classic Castlevania games)*
- Classic enemies from the old games to come back with their iconic designs but just modernized a bit
- Soundtrack meant to invoke memories of playing the NES and SNES Castlevania games
- Whip is used to attack as well as grab items or even get to areas out of reach of a normal jump
- Bring back the wall meat behind secret breakable walls!
- Classic items like the cross, the throwing axe and holy water to return and with some new functionality to make them useful in a 3D environment 
- Base game features a full and complete story of the main character, Simon Belmont, defeating Dracula
- Each DLC is it’s own story with new locations, enemies, and you play as a new character with unique weapons and items",0,0.4,24,2020-09-25 13:15:26
Could we see the return of couch co-op with next gen?,tramp000,"The last two generations it was difficult for consoles to run games with two camera views at a solid FPS and decent resolution. Most Devs priorities lied in just getting the best they could with one camera. 
But with next gen being able to hit some pretty lofty visual targets. Might be a return of couch co-op, 2 camera views at 60fps but at maybe 1080p instead of 4k. Seems like a reasonable compromise.

With all the hoo-ah about the PS5's SSD and just how fast it is, In comparison to the competition. Do we think we may get ""fake"" loading screens where in reality we are waiting for them to load the game up?
If this is the case how would you all feel about that? Would you want a (quote) fake (unquote) loading screen. Where in reality your console is good to go. Assets all loaded etc etc. But your waiting for others to the load the game up for say 1minute (as an example).",0,0.22,40,2020-09-25 06:37:49

Sony can and should offer PS5 enhanced versions of PS4 games for free like microsoft.,2FAST2FURIOUS993,"Microsoft lets you buy a copy of grand theft auto 4 13 years ago and still support it on their next generation hardware. Sony can't even make a enhanced version of spiderman ps4 free to current owners. This is the same BS in my opinion as offering ps3 classics you have to pay for rather than allowing you to get them free if you already own then on the ps3.

I'm just wondering what others in this community think about this.


Edit: ok so GTA IV was a bad example (but a fantastic game, pls be on ps5), basically my point was that CDPR, ubisoft, microsoft and a few others have said that the next generation version, as in the entire updated/enhanced game will be available to current owners for free.
These games are going to be a goodwill to consumers who are early adopters to new platforms and will hopefully be available years into the generation.

Sony is ""remastering"" a 2 year old game rather than providing a substantial update, this is a ploy to get people to buy it twice, they are clearly not trying to bolster sales to people who do not own it because it's only available as a collectors edition on top of the sequel. It's not only locked behind another game like modern warfare remastered, it's also a paid enhanced version that of it was another developer you'd probably get free.",641,0.72,791,2020-09-25 06:24:08

Expanding Your PS5 Drive Space? Note That NVMe Drives Must Be Whitelisted by Sony,vgskid,"I’m seeing a lot of chatter after Microsoft released their SSD expansion drive ($220!!!!). That’s honestly a lot of money. However, I’m seeing a lot of response from people saying that thank goodness PS5 will take any NVMe drive which can have prices anywhere from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on size. 

However, you need to note that Sony must [whitelist the SSD drive](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5)

You can’t use any NVMe drive, so please don’t buy a cheap one you found online thinking it’ll work. I don’t believe anything has been officially whitelisted by Sony yet. There’s one drive that people are assuming might work, which is [this one](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price).

Note that it’s $229 for 1TB. The cost of super fast load times and world loading is expensive. At least for now. *So I just wanted to warn people and inform people to just wait for a bit until we get official confirmation from Sony on which drives will work. And brace yourself on price. Maybe they’ll be $229, maybe they’ll be less, but they definitely won’t be cheap. Don’t buy a NVMe drive until we get confirmation that it’ll work in the system.*

Edit: There’s some discussion of semantics on what “whitelisting” means in this article. It’s beside the point. Sony and Mark Cerny have already stated they will provide a list of compatible drives. If the system may allow drives that Sony doesn’t recommend but still technically work, that’s up to individuals to try. For the vast majority of you, focus on the italicized text above and do not buy anything until Sony provides a list of compatible drives. The system doesn’t take just any NVMe drive and buying some random cheap one off Amazon will not work.",707,0.95,479,2020-09-25 05:21:06

"Jason Schreier says FFXVI has been in development for ""at least 4 years"" and will release sooner than people think",butterbeancd,"This comment came in Schreier's most recent podcast episode.

Schreier is a well-connected insider who has broken countless industry stories, so his information carries a bit more weight to me than most ""insider"" knowledge.

I think it's understandable that a lot of people have made ""see you in 2025"" jokes after what happened with FFXV and FFVII Remake. However, it's important to remember that the team behind FFXVI is a completely different team from those games. They share none of the same leaders, and the team behind FFXVI is known for its efficiency (primarily due to their work on the MMO, FFXIV). But this is the first time we've gotten specific info about how long the game has been in development, and I think it's longer than most people realized.

How to improve PS Now?,schneper,"While PS Now has more than enough titles to be played, the majority of games have to be streamed. Only certain PS4 and surprisingly PS2 titles can be downloaded. There is no way to emulate PS3 games. Streaming games requires a very strong internet connection, preferably a wired connection or 5ghz wireless. However, the quality of streamed games via PS Now isn't up to the quality compared to other cloud based services (e.g. GeForce Now). How could Sony make the service much more appealing to costumers? Here are some points that i think would greatly enhance the service:

1. **Make PS Now a software based full backwards compatibility solution:**

\- Bring back the game catalog of PS1 classics and expand the games we have on PS Now

\- Make it possible to emulate PS3 games  (maybe the PS5 could do it?) OR improve the streaming quality;

\- PSNow should be the ""game pass"" of older Playstation games

**2. Tie in the Playstation Store**

\- The PS4 can emulate PS2 games; why didnt we get the PS2 games we bought digitally back in the store? -&gt; apply this to PS1 games aswell

\- Games available on PSNow should be able to be bought through the PS Store (apply this for PS4 and PS5 users)

**3. PS Plus**

\- PSNow should be included in PS Plus OR in a PS Plus Premium subscription

\- Give away one month of PSNow (or PS Plus) whenever someone buys accessoires for their consoles (like controllers)

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to see PS Now as a software solution to the missing full backwards compatibility we have on the PS5. Bring back PS1 and PS2 games into the PS Store, because there really is no reason to keep those games away from the store, when we can already see that the PS4 console can emulate PS2 games through PSNow. Also, if it can emulate PS2 games, it should also be able to emulate PS1 games easily. I admit PS3 games are tricky, and if the PS5 is not able to emulate PS3 games, then Sony should improve their cloud based gaming.

**TL;DR:** Bring back PS1/PS2 games to the store, add those games into PSNow, improve cloud based gaming for PS3 games, include the service in PS Plus or in a new ""Premium"" PS Plus subscription",47,0.73,79,2020-09-25 02:52:47

Appreciation of future proofing,hmma31595,"With 49 days left to go I wanted to draw some attention to some of the benefits of an upgrade that aren’t necessarily game related. The quality of life stuff that as a launch PS4 owner are the biggest reasons I’m super amped for the next generation. Those being the NVME expandable storage, WiFi 6, and HDMI 2.1. All of those are yet to be ubiquitous, and while we may have a slightly weaker console it’s amazing that they packed years worth of upgrades in for the same cost as a competitor. 

WiFi 6 is still potentially limited for some things on PlayStation’s end, but with game streaming and digital downloads becoming more and more prevalent and gigabit internet becoming more common it’s awesome that we may see much higher throughput. 

NVME upgradeable internal storage is a HUGE win. Not being locked to a certain size or company could benefit us immensely in terms of cost in the long run. 

HDMI 2.1 is already here, though not super affordable yet. While I don’t see these consoles ever hitting 8K with some insane DLSS style magic 4K 120 already feels like a great late gen target for especially first party titles. 

Let me know if I’m out of line or missed something!

TLDR; I’m really excited for the quality of life stuff on PS5, a couple that aren’t even available with competitors. Next gen is all about convenience and I’m here for it.",29,0.65,113,2020-09-25 00:56:50

For all those worried that £70 will become the standard game price,ChrisRR,"Game prices are typically inflated at launch due to a captive market.  This link, thanks to u/xenorvernix shows that most launch titles were priced at £55.

I really don't like the location of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. so listen to me rant about it,Swarica,"Not going to lie, kind of got mad when I heard in the trailer, ""This is the best part of living in Harlem."" Yea I know Harlem is cool and I know that's where he lives in the Spider-Man for PS4 game, but the map is going to be an exact copy of the PS4 map. Unless you can go farther north of Manhattan I don't really want to just play a copy of Spider-Man for PS4 if the only difference is the story and characters.

In my humble opinion I think it should've taken place is Brooklyn, and here's why

1. Miles lives in Brooklyn. In the original comics, most tv show's he's been referenced in. Heck, even Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
2. Brooklyn is a completely different map. New places to explore and people can get over playing in Manhattan and move onto Brooklyn. I think it's idiotic that they just copy and pasted the exact same thing. At least move the location
3. Brooklyn is so much better than Manhattan. First, it's skyline is still pretty large and if that's the only reason it's still in Manhattan is because it's skyline is slightly smaller that's like saying L.A. is better because the hills are bigger than San Diego. Second, People who aren't familiar with Brooklyn can get to know at least the basics. I had no idea where things were in Manhattan but Spider-Man for PS4 taught me that. I think we're all ready to move on to Manhattan's younger but cooler sister. And Third, Manhattan is boring to at least me... I can't tell you how many times I've played PS4 Spider-Man but then just got bored of Manhattan. I wished I could go to Brooklyn or even at least to liberty island but no. Just same old Manhattan
4. And finally, Why not? It's not like there's gonna be any problems. One, If it's because Brooklyn is too big, then just cut a few things out. Not all of Brooklyn has to be there. And if it's because Brooklyn has some parts that are mostly residential and filled with one story/two story houses... well
5. Why they shouldn't... There are a ton of parts in Brooklyn where it's just mostly residential houses and not apartments or tall skyscrapers. But of course there are in Manhattan too. Not as much of course but still. I think that is one of the main reasons why they won't stage it in Brooklyn, but I still think Brooklyn would be a lovely place for a Spider-Man to take place in. So get on that

EDIT:

So I've gotten the feedback I wanted and turns out the game wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. People have told me it's more of an expansion pack than a new game in of itself. And it seems some people do agree with me. But in the wrong context

People agree that when actual Spider-Man 2 comes out, then yes it would be amazing to be able to go to Brooklyn and or... Jersey City? Anyway people really didn't agree with me ranting about this game. The game I was ranting about was a game that was just more of an expansion pack than a new game. And yea I didn't know that and yea I probably should've researched it before making a 5-6 paragraph post ranting about it.

In conclusion. I still think that going to Brooklyn in actual Spider-Man 2 would be awesome. But for now I understand why they wouldn't for this game. ",0,0.23,29,2020-09-24 15:42:17

Are These M Rated Games Appropriate For A 13 Year Old?,Cool_Kid13,"A bit of back round knowledge I am a 13 year old who is a soon to be first time play PlayStation owner.

Like many of you I am really excited for the PlayStation 5. I was one of the lucky few who was able to preorder the PlayStation 5. I plan to use the PlayStation 5 for backwards compatibility for the first one to two years. I already have the Uncharted games, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ratchet and Clank. My problem is that there are four M rated games I want to play, these are God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. I cant play these games legally unless my parents buy the games for me. So what makes these games M rated? My parents would be ok with stuff like bad words and a bit of blood but things like really gory stuff or other stuff I don't know about. So If you can leave a reply about stuff that happens in these games that would be nice and if you need to know more i'll try to answer people.

TL;DR Im 13 and want these M rated games God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. What makes them M rated?

UPDATE

I looked at what many people have said. I think I am going to get Persona 5 and God of War. People said the other to games were a bit much, I will wait to get those games till I am older. People said god of war is a lot of fantasy violence and bad words which is ok. I still kinda think about if my parents will let me play Persona 5 but, Many of you said I had Important themes that could show me good morales. I'll probably ask for these games in Christmas season and thats when my parents will look into this stuff. So thanks for helping me with the good advice!",182,0.79,370,2020-09-24 08:58:09

"SOCOM Is Sony’s Opportunity to compete against Call of Duty, and they seriously need it",OxEagle19,"This is probably going to get seriously downvoted, but I think it needs to be said. While Sony has gotten a great reputation for their single-player exclusives, none of their IP can match the behemoth amount of popularity and clout as the Call off Duty series and Fortnite. 

Why does that matter?

Sony has been aggressively making third-Party deals to make PS5 the best place to play those games, whether it be their deals with Activision, Rockstar, timed exclusivity with Bethesda, or exclusive DLC from the Marvel Avengers Game. And while that may help Sony in the short-term, they need their own IP that is as large as a publishers like Square Enix, Rockstar, or Activision. The reason why is because they simply cannot afford to just straight up buy studios like that, at least not as large as those I just mentioned. Sure Sony is building their own reputation with these IP’s, God of War, The Last of Us, and many more, but these IP’s don’t make the same amount of money as COD, Battlefield, FIFA, Fortnite or any battle royale game. They absolutely need at least one IP as big as them because if Microsoft can just throw money at a studio like ZeniMax and own them, it doesn’t matter if those games are put on PS5, if Microsoft felt like it, they could just not put those games on there. We could speculate whether they would or wouldn’t, but that doesn’t matter, the very fact that they COULD isn’t something to take lightly and should be combated.

I think SOCOM has the potential to be as big an IP as Call of Duty, and it needs to be so that way they have at least one game that has a similar wide amount of appeal and monetization that they have more power to sway others to the ecosystem, and more importantly have the cash to rival Microsoft. This is just my opinion, but I do think it’s important that Sony as a whole has the buying power to sway others from getting bought out completely by negotiating third-Party deals, and Sony needs that cash cow where their profits are exceedingly high compared to the cost to produce them. And plus, SOCOM kicked ass, it deserves a comeback, and knowing Sony, it could be a cash cow without being soulless either. And please, I’m not a fanboy, I just don’t want Microsoft to become have a monopoly on gaming.",0,0.43,59,2020-09-24 03:47:17

Is anyone else shocked by the entitlement?,zslayer89,"This is mostly referring to Spider-Man Remaster, but could apply to future games.

I've been seeing people in lots of threads essentially crapping all over Insomniac and Sony for charging for the remaster of SM. People are stating that the remaster should be free and cite that other games are getting free upgrade paths to PS5.

Now I'm not opposed to games getting free upgrade paths to the PS5. But what is coming with those upgrades? If it's minor work that equates to the flip of the switch that provides better fps, slightly better graphics and even better load times, then yes that should be free. People like to bring up Witcher 3 and the free upgrades its getting, but from what's stated in articles that people cite, it sounds like the witcher is mostly(I know they said something about ray tracing) just getting upscaled graphics,fps bump and load bump.

But a game like SM:remaster isn't just doing that. [Here](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/16/see-the-marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-new-gameplay-demo/) you will see that the remaster isn't a simple upscale job. Insomniac went back to a 2 year old game and completely updated many assets. There will be better hair, facial animations, skin, eyes, the new model for Peter. Also you'll they added ray-traced reflections and ambient shadows, improved lighting, more pedestrians and vehicles stretching further into the distance, and the same optional performance mode offered on Miles Morales. This will  allow you to play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate. The remaster will be supporting near-instant loading, 3D audio, and the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback. They are also  adding three new Spider-Man suits, new photo mode features, and new trophies.


Then people start talking about Cyberpunk giving a free ps5 upgrade down the line as some kind of major counter point. It's not. Cyber Punk has been in development for quite some time, and it's very likely that they knew that the next gen console wasn't far off. This means that time was built in to have these upgrades ready at some point after launch. It's not like SM (2018) that has been completed for two years and is now being reworked for the PS5. I've also heard that because of the fact that it's releasing on PC, the development is concurrent and that makes it easier to develop for the next gen consoles. 


I don't know, it's just shocking to me. It's like if someone is doing someone's backyard and make it look super nice (a new deck, new lawn, some trees, a water feature) they get paid when they complete the job. Now the job is complete and time has passed and you want to update your backyard a bit, update some features to make them look nicer, and in some cases replace certain parts all together, well that takes time and will be paid for as well. It likely won't cost the same as doing the original project, but still changes were made and new things are being added in. 

What do you all think? What should be the criteria for free upgrades and what should be the criteria for a paid upgrade? To me, if you are going back and putting in a lot of new things into an old game, that should be paid. If it's just what amount to performance bumps, graphics quality increases etc, that should be free.

I wish we knew the expected lifespan of the DualSense.,Moto507,"Most of my controller failures have been from triggers going bad. And the DualSense is ditching the typical trigger springs used in the Dualshock 4. These new triggers sound incredible too. Between the ability to increase pressure as the trigger is pulled and lock it at certain points, I can't wait to try it out. So we'll have this new tech in our hands and no statements as to whether or not it'll last longer. Especially since games these days are much more reliant on the triggers. I remember when shooters used face buttons to fire, and acceleration in racers was X. Now they're fully on the triggers for ADS/FIRE and BRAKE/GAS. Also joining them is action games with the influence of Dark Souls bringing light and heavy attacks to the bumper and trigger respectively. What at one point were just buttons on the front of the controller, are now arguably the most heavily used functions across nearly every genre.

"Sony should buy Konami's franchises like Castlevania, MGS, Contra, Silent Hill, Pro Evolution Soccer",Konval,"Boy oh boy what I wouldn't do for a Soulsborne-esque Castlevania. Its a huge franchise that Konami has been mishandling for a long time. The Netflix show is a hit and the sweet memory of Symphony of the Night is on every original Playstation fan's mind.

With PES, Sony could have a decent alternative/competitor to Fifa, which honestly has been going down in quality for basically a decade. I know EA has monopoly on licenses, but Sony could do something creative to work around it.

Contra could be remade in 3D and be similar to Doom or even Killzone, or it could stay 2D and be reborn as a rogue-like series.

MGS and Silent Hill... nothing needs to be said. Konami virtually seppuku'd with these two franchises. 

Seeing as how Konami basically exited the console market the time is perfect for Sony to swoop in and buy the rights to these franchises. I wouldn't want Sony to outright buy them; Konami can keep YuGiOh and whatever they are doing in the mobile gaming market. What are your thoughts?",69,0.63,153,2020-09-23 11:33:13

Issue with existing Sam's Club order - I advise everyone that lives in an apartment building to check their order,obtusekomodo," The address on my profile includes my apartment number - the ""Ship to:"" address on my order DOES NOT include my apartment number.

Their recommendation was to cancel my order and order it again (not happening).

The solution is to wait until November 10th (when it will ship) and call them - they will conference me with FedEx and add the apartment number whilst it is in transit. I'll be camping in my lobby on the 12th.

"Insomniac is finally first party, it's time to return to the Resistance",jolly_chugger,"Resistance 2 is one of the best realised, and most genuinely enjoyable games I've ever played. 

Single player. The story, the foreboding, the descent into madness. You play as an absolute superhuman, hot on the trail of the leaders and the dark secrets swirling behind the scenes. The final scene of resistance 2 will forever be etched in my mind,

""Can you hear them calling to us? It's beautiful"" + fade to black + gunshot

FULL CO-OP! But this ain't yo mommas co-op. In Resistance you play as a member on one of the teams charged with cleaning up and preparing the way for the main character in the single player game. Skills, progression, immersion, again one of the best co-op experiences that has only been exceeded by monster Hunter in my mind

Multiplayer. No longer are you a god, nor a super soldier, you're now a grunt. The lowest of the low you fight in the constant meat grinder of the frontlines in the ongoing alien invasion. Praying to last long enough for some faceless hero to stem the incessant tides so you can see tomorrow. In this mode you actually step in to the shoes of the chimera, which was mind blowing

Then there were the brilliant guns. The auger, hedgehog, marksman rifle, etc. All the guns felt great, and packed with personality

Unfortunately Resistance 3 threw out basically every thing great about 2 and signaled its untimely demise. Although it is interesting how much it foreshadowed naughty dog's eventual masterpiece, TLOU

With guerrilla going hard on horizon, Sony is short of a flagship shooter.

Here's my dreams for next gen:

-either microsoft makes ES6, doom, and starfield available on ps5, or they make game pass available on ps5. I need a good pc for music production but id rather do all my gaming on the ps5 with duelsense.

-Sony buys FROM software, and gives that sweet funding and support to future souls like titles. 

-Resistance fall of man remake

-60fps Bloodborne

-Square Enix, Kojima productions, capcom, and rockstar stay 3rd party devs.

- I hope demon souls does really well and then bluepoint try to make their own soulslike IP. That gameplay looks soo clean.

- A Sony Studio making a full out RPG akin to Skyrim in open endedness.

- Naughty Dog making a new Linear Story IP with a whole new vibe. Maybe a sci fi, or a detective story, or a war story. 

- Pleeeease let Hogwarts Legacy be good. The franchise desperately needs a good entry. 

- I want the Dune movie to do really well and then get either a linear story or open world game on Arrakis. Im a huge nerd for the books. Crysknife and lasgun combat and survival mechanics when in the desert. Video game worms. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm

- An ancient egypt open world game not part of assassins creed.

- Probably wont happen but I want Portal 1 and 2 remastered and released as 1 game on ps5.

- Remake RDR1 in the RDR2 map (adding in mexico). Make it playable after beating the RDR2 story. It would just make so much sense. Would warrant a replay so hard.

- kojima made silent hill reboot. 

- a good remake of Resident Evil 4

- for atomic heart to be as good as it looks

- for the duelsense battery to last a very long time on a full charge.

- rockband 4 complete edition where it comes with every song (dlc and base game) from all 4 games, plus ps5 compatible instruments. Not a lot of hope for this one lol

- an open world game where you play as a cop, and part of the main story involves discovering corruption within your own police force regarding a crime conspiracy, and then going rogue to stop it.

I don’t think the Sony preorder invites were as random as we thought,ohmyitsmeluigi,"I don’t think the Sony invites were as random as we thought, and here’s why

First off, I am not an expert on marketing in any way shape or form, but I do think I see why some people got the Sony invite and others didn’t. 

Let’s first look at how you signed up for a chance to get an invite. We were all able to send in our PSN name to be placed on an email list of the possibility to get a pre-order invite. Sony, being a big tech company, has more than enough resources to create a computer system to filter through all those who put their PSN name in their data base. They can look at how often you play, how often you buy digital games, how long you’ve owned a PlayStation product, etc. 

Now let’s look at those who did and didn’t get an invite. This is all based on the megathread comments and not any real information. From reading the comments, there was many complaints about how people didn’t get their invite for a preorder, even though they spend hours and hours playing games, spending tons of money on buying digital games, having every single PlayStation console, and having x amount platinum trophies. You’re what you call a hardcore PlayStation player. And another complaint I would hear from the hardcore PlayStation players was that a lot of their friends who got the invite hardly play as often as they do. Or they barely got their PS4 a few months ago. How did they get an invite and I didn’t? Here what I think is why

I believe those who aren’t hardcore PlayStation players are casual players. And Sony wanted to cater towards those casual players to get them to buy their product. More than likely, those of you who are considered casual gamers would buy a system eventually, either when it comes out, or later on during its life cycle. Or even if you do plan on buying a console, it’s possible you were already on the fence about which console to buy. I mean, let’s face it, Xbox has one heck of a deal with their monthly plan being available. They wanted to sway the casual gamer towards the PlayStation by sending them a very special invite that basically guarantees them a preorder. But why not the hardcore PlayStation fan? Because they figure hardcore gamers are more than likely going to buy a PS5 regardless if they get an invite or not. Now those of you who didn’t get an invite, ask yourself, are you still looking for a PS5 everyday? And if you can’t find one today, will you look tomorrow? And if you answered yes to these questions, Sony has you where they want you. 

Let’s look at how they marketed the PS5 as well. First off they created two different, but the same systems. A digital and a disk version. These were not revealed for the longest time and neither were their prices and release dates. When it comes to their prices and release date for preorders, they wanted to create a mock supply and demand by placing the preorders out of the blue soon after their event. I think this was by design more than we think. Yes, I do also think it was to keep away scalpers. Which was smart. But it also created a panic of, “Oh no! I have to get one now! Where can I find it?! They’re all sold out of preorders!” And that’s when they started to send out the invites. After the initial frenzy that occurred. It’s like they were playing mental games amongst its users by saying all no it’s all gone, but you are a special one and you’ll get an invite. 

This all might just be bogus, but this is why I think the Sony invites were not as random as we thought. What do you all think?

EDIT: This is all speculation. There is no conclusive evidence to this at all. It was just a thought that I had. Accessibility is huge with marketing. If you can’t access it, then you can’t buy it. If you’re a casual player and don’t have access to an immediate preorder, you’re less likely going to seek a preorder out. And to change up a little to what I had to say, “Casual players were more likely to get an invite than hardcore players”",0,0.32,21,2020-09-22 23:20:40

Digital versions of the PS5 may only make up 15-20% of the available stock.

This is on top of the fact that the $100 lower cost means that the demand for the digital edition seems to be pretty high. 

I’m guessing that Sony knows that, initially, people will probably be willing to pay more to be one of the first people to get them. 

Also, if they think they can rapidly sell pretty much all the units they can manufacture, it is only logical to have the factory churning out the more expensive version at first. 


With that in mind, if you are racing to snag one when pre orders go up, you are probably more likely to get one if you go for the standard edition.",707,0.94,457,2020-09-22 21:45:50

If there is one thing Sony can learn from bethesda acquisition is that timed exclusives are not the way forward,teenaxta,"Lately Sony has been pushing timed exclusives really hard.  **Bugsnax, Deathloop, GhostWire: Tokyo, Godfall, Kena Bridge of spirits,  Oddworld: Soulstorm** these are all timed exclusives. 

In some cases timed exclusives are good. Where you give a small developer the budget to develop their games and in return you get it as a timed exclusive like in the case of Nier Automata. but in most other cases, its a No no.

Not only will these games come to other consoles, it feels wasted potential. Rather than getting timed exclusivity deal on so many games, Sony should acquire or develop a new studio. At least by doing so you get to own the IP, the talent and the pedigree.  A single proper high budget exclusive like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon Zero Dawn does more for the console prestige than 4-5 timed exclusives. These games become ambassadors of the console, while the timed exclusive part is forgotten. Now I am not saying that Sony should go and buy a big publisher, but they should be on the look out for studios with potential, like they did with insomniac.",0,0.43,128,2020-09-22 21:13:42
Why do we still know so little about the PS5!?,theothrsn27,"idk if this has already been posted anywhere, but what is going on with Sony this year!? I know there was the pandemic, but that doesn't excuse the pure lack of information Sony has given us still. It's such a massive contrast to what they did with the PS4 launch. Not that any of this will change me getting it, it's just incredibly frustrating.

Biggest things for me that I still want to know are:

* Do saves carry over for ps4 games?
* Is there still remote play?

What does everyone else want to know??

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I know spider-man is a unique situation with it being part of the Miles Morales Ultimate edition. That part makes sense (although still frustrating since I still have some DLC to finish and want to do new game + )  Would like to know if this is going to be the norm though. Also not thrilled at the prospect of paying $70 for a ps5 texture pack basically and having to start my game over. ",296,0.77,329,2020-09-22 20:48:49

New IP vs Sequel/Remake,anonymousss11,"I personally am not a fan of remakes and to an extent sequels (but not as much). I've already played the game, why do I need to play it again? 

Just been hearing this a lot recently ""So and so should totally remake 'this game'!"" or ""I loved 'this game' they should really make a sequel!"" 

Hear me out. I would so much rather a team work on something totaly new than spend their time remaking an old game. 

I'm not against sequels if they fit but a sequel just for sequels sake not a fan of that.(I have been pleasantly surprised by some)

For example. 

If Sucker Punch just made an Infamous sequel we'd never have gotten Ghost of Tsushima. 

Or of they made a Sly remake, no Ghost.

I think there are a lot of misconceptions about the difference between PS4 back compat games vs next gen patches vs remasters,goosetheboss1,"Folks say, well you can just play 2018 Spiderman on the PS5 why pay extra for the ultimate edition of Miles Morales?

In my mind, a remaster will likely include all new textures, possibly run in the engine from MM rather than the older version used in 2018. 

Not to mention possibly adding content or using more features of the PS5 than just “it loads faster”. 

I understand a lot of company’s are doing patches to make their older games run better but my bet is that they are not full remasters for the new system taking advantage of haptic feedback, Improved AI possibilities etc. Most likely these “upgraded” games will run at a higher frame rate, add in RT or just load much faster.

In all, I think paying $20 for a remastered version of 2018 Spiderman will probably be worth it as long as it takes some of the new features of the PS5 and implements then.",17,0.66,45,2020-09-22 19:41:21

Imagine what PlayStation could do with proper backing.,King_A_Acumen,"Like we all know that the only reason Xbox has stuck around for so long is that MS could keep throwing money at it, the reason Gamepass is there is because MS can just keep on eating the losses.

Sometimes I wonder what PS could do if they had similar backing to what Xbox has. I feel like if PS did have proper backing there would be a PS version of Gamepass and what not. Xbox also has the benefit of having huge teams of people to draw from other MS services.

I hope that PS does somehow create a gamepass thing because it would be great, I understand the high prices of games but I would like a Netflix but for gaming or atleast something like Disney+ for Sony first-party games.

Everyone suggests names like Capcom, Konami, Square Enix and FROM. Are any of these feasible? Personally I think Take 2 is simple too expensive.

As for companies like Apple, they announce their products a couple days before they release them and still sell very well.

Physical game copies,Suhdud99,"I think we can all agree on the excitement of the ps5 and all of the upcoming games, but before any information was released about the console or games way back last year, I was pretty confident that games were going to move from disks to more of a memory card esk type deal (think XSX expandable storage but for games instead)
It was a given the console was going to have a disk drive as it's also considered an entertainment centre for most so removing the disk drive would have been a terrible move.
But with the new console focusing more on load times this gen, I was sort of expecting a new kind of physical copy for games.
I know disks nowadays can hold a massive amount of information compared to say 10 years ago but has the read/write speed increased with this also?
I'm not really in the know when it comes to these types of specifications but would having games on 'game cards ' been faster than disk games?",0,0.38,16,2020-09-21 23:13:06

I understand this happened the first time, but the tweet from Playstation clearly says that retailers would share more details in the future. I took this as them telling us that the retailers would give us plenty of advance notice on what day and what time they would let us buy a PS5. It wouldn't make sense for Sony to apologize, and then have the same thing that happened last week happen again. I am absolutely certain retailers will give at least an hour notice in advance before the PS5 is available to purchase again, and they'll probably post that information on their Twitter.

What games is everyone getting in the first month the PS5 wil be out?,majoraswrath360," I'm probably going with: Demons Souls, Assassins Creed, Immortals: Fenyx Rising.

Immortals Fenyx Rising actually looks like a better Zelda breath of the wild  clone. So I'm very interested in that after seeing 40min gameplay. So  here is crossing my fingers that this new IP turns out as great as the  demo looked.

Before someone mentions Cyberpunk; I'm probably going to wait until those PS5 specific upgrades are done. That  will probably take a few months.

Games from the PS3 that need a PS5 port or remaster:,coreyc444,"Sometimes a game doesn't always get its fair share because of programming of a console or it's just not the right time for that specific game. I definitely think there are some ps3 games that didn't get what they deserve and should be remastered for the PS5

1. Mod Nation Racers
This game is awesome. The best cart racer I've played in years. The major problem with this game was the horrendous loading screens. If we can get this game over to a system with an awesome ssd it can those once again. This game was better than Mario kart in my opinion. The customization was stellar. Sony needs to bring this one back in a remaster. Not much else needs to be changed. The game still holds up today.
2. Socom
Socom was Sony's first foray into online multiplayer and it killed the franchise after the PSN outage of 2011. This is no reason to kill that franchise. Getting this game back in a free to play type game could certainly boon Sony's first party presence. 
3. Resistance 1-3
These games are excellent scifi shooters with a great story. The weapon variety is imaginative in a very bleak world. Insomniac continues to tease these games. Getting us a remaster of these games would be awesome. 
4. Starhawk
Starhawk is an excellent. Real time combat and strategy military game. Building a base and creating ways to overcome your opponents in the game is a blast. With how online multiplayer has increased since this game it would be awesome to bring this back with customization options and adding even more game mode would be great.

While we wait for launch: day what’s your favorite PlayStation memory and why?,betabetafishfish,"Hi friends,

We don’t have too much time left before the state of this sub evolves into a proper console forum. Before we get there, I’ve been enjoying the casual posts on here so I want to chat about our favorite PlayStation memories.

I have a ton. I’m a Nintendo fanboy at heart, but Sony has always held a special place with me since the PS1. I think my favorite memories are tied to playing The Last of Us. Sure, the game is awe-inspiring, but it’s more about where I was at in life. I was a freshman in college, pretty aimless, and all the other tropes of being an early twenty-something year old. But playing through that game with the people in my life at the time was a very special thing. Not to get cheesy on everyone, but it’s like the quote  “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”

When the PS4 launched, I played the Remastered version of the game. I would often leave the console idle and my theme at the time was this [one](https://youtu.be/Xr6OnQZUFW4). Hearing it idle now immediately takes me back to where I was living and the headspace I was in. And that was years and years ago.

Okay, I’m done getting nostalgic. What are YOUR favorite PlayStation memories?

Any interest in a Jurassic Park game for next-gen?,WigglingWeiner,"Just finished watching Camp Cretaceous. Awesome show, definitely not for kids. Anyway...

It got me thinking, how come there is not a proper survival Jurassic Park game? The entire park, and you have to scavenge, look for food, water, weapons.

You have to cover your scent with Dino shit or piss, look for a map/gps to watch out for the territory which Dino is mostly roaming/found roaming in.

Get hunted by velociraptors, collectibles like finding books about how to possibly hunt/find info about specific dinosaurs, ala exhibits found in various parts of the park. 

Maintenance tunnels too, with the Park Adventure kayak/monorail.

Climb high canopies/climb trees, etc!

Roam through high grass and stumble upon corpses of dinosaurs, only to realize you stumbled upon a T-Rex nest

What's the likelihood of Sony putting a PS3 emulating software on PS5 in the future?,DogParksAreForbidden,"What do you think the likelihood is?

We've had a viable PS3 emulator on PC now for at least a couple of years, and it runs almost every PS3 game out there. If a small group of unpaid community members, investing free time and living off donations can do it, I'm sure it would be a joke for Sony to actually make one.

Personally, I'd even buy it as a one-time paid app if it meant I could play my PS3 discs and digital titles on my PS5. I'm glad they put in PS4 support, but I'm really hoping that maybe even in a year's time we see Sony contribute something towards PS3 backwards compatibility. It's a feature I want the most.

Sony did say that they will have more PS5s for launch then PS4 but they are launching this generation in more countries on the first day then they did with the PS4 https://www.google.com/search?q=ps4+launch+dates&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari

I truly believe there is going to be large shortage of PS5s during the holiday season. Yes! Sony has said 15 million units but that’s within the first quarter of 2021. 

Sony has not said how many units will be available by this Christmas and the fact that there releasing in much more countries on launch day November 12th.

Edit: let’s not forget COVID. The whole world shut down for months. This is a fact!

Let’s be honest here, COVID effected the whole world. Do you really think it didn’t effect production of the PS5?",0,0.35,25,2020-09-21 09:54:50

PS5/ Next Gen for the future of esports,NendoBot,"Ok ok, hear me out. With how powerful these consoles are going to be and how light most e-sports titles are, these could be some serious e-sports machines if Sony and/or Microsoft  wanted. 

Games like Overwatch or RS6 Siege for example. These consoles can seriously get great performance on these e-sports titles with 120 fps. It could allow for keyboard and mouse support and allow them to play on a separate server compared to controller only. Allowing for an easy entry into these e-sports titles while still being able to compete and hopefully play along side with the actual e-sports scene on these consoles.

All I am saying is these consoles could be a serious contender for streaming or playing e-sports titles if  Sony wanted to.",0,0.18,2,2020-09-21 08:45:06
"First time PS player, looking for advice",PseudonymousUsername,"Hey, I’m considering getting the PS5 to play with friends, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

My friends all currently have PS4s, and won’t be upgrading to the PS5 until next year at least. I‘ve read party chat will work between consoles, as well as a few games.

Would I have to buy the PS4 editions of those games to play with my friends, then buy the PS5 editions when they switch? Or do you think the library of backwards compatible games available at launch will even be enough to play with my PS4 friends?

I have no idea how any of this works; haven’t owned a console since the 360. Any help is greatly appreciated.",28,0.69,31,2020-09-21 08:09:35
Movie disc formats playable on a PS5?,Possible_Ninja,"Hey all, this is probably a dumb question, but I don't think I've bought a movie on a disc in about 8 years. But now that I'm seeing that the PS5 will act as a 4K Blu-ray player, I'm thinking it might be fun to build a small library of favorite movies to display on a shelf.

Does this mean the PS5 can play regular blu ray discs as well as 4k Blu-ray? Is Blu-ray 3D any different?

I'm assuming that it won't play DVD or HDDVD - I'm guessing those formats are dead?

Please Sony, make it able to deactivate the triggers when we're watching. Or stop using them altogether, or lock the joypad, turn it off with a quick one-press button combination, or something...! This would make a prefect console for me :)

"Considering the PS5 has similar internal structures to the PS4 Pro, (presumably) for supporting backwards compatibility, how is that not holding the PS5 back?",iwojima22,"All this talk about the Series S, backwards compatibility and PS5 going cross gen but not much about how Sony accomplished PS4 backwards compatibility. Especially why it’s only PS4. 

Not even Sony is clear on if these games will be upgraded, only that they’re getting them to properly run or “take advantage of the Pro’s enhancements.” But the PS5 has the same amount of Compute Units as the PS4 Pro. Most likely a design choice for easy backwards compatibility, as opposed to Microsoft actually putting in effort to design their hardware to support all generations AND free visual upgrades across the board. 

What if the PS5 had 52 compute units, like the Series X, as opposed to 36, just like the PS4 Pro? Wouldn’t they be able to make even beefier games? 

Here’s Jim Ryan in 2017 responding to Sony’s backwards compatibility efforts[ “When we’ve dabbled with backwards compatibility, I can say it is one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much,” says Ryan. “That, and I was at a Gran Turismo event recently where they had PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games, and the PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?”](https://time.com/4804768/playstation-4-ps4-pro-psvr-sales/) I highly doubt they’ve changed their tune in 2020 so I wouldn’t expect any older games getting visual upgrades because “why would anybody play this.” I guess. It seems they’d rather cut corners and implement a half assed PS4 backwards compatibility approach by having similar internals than to actually put in effort.",0,0.21,34,2020-09-21 06:18:31

It would be really interesting if they could add a functionality like what TrackIR does where it tracks the movement of the head like an extension of the right stick in games where there's freelook

An example of this could be seen in Gran Turismo, imagine you are racing in the cockpit view and want to see how close a car is to your side,  so instead of using the minimap or using the right stick to view left or right, you just turn your head a little and the camera looks in that direction

Regional Pricing. A Brief Look.,imcrazyandproud,"The conversation about the increase in games prices has been dominated by the $10 increase in the USA but its important to see how these prices have changed worldwide especially with the digital only PS5. 

UK £55 -&gt; £70   an increase by  $19.37 to  $90.42  

EU  € 70 -&gt;  € 80 an increase by  $11.84  to $94.73

Aus $100 -&gt; $125 an increase by $18.23 to $91.15

Jpn   ¥7,590 - &gt; ¥7,900 an increase by $2.96 to $75.55  

California\* (after sales tax) $ 64.95 -&gt; $75.77  an increase of $10.82

&amp;#x200B;

America has had increadible games prices in comparison to the rest of the world. Sony's implementation of regional pricing is completely screwing over the EU/UK/Aus and treats them as second class in comparison. This jump to next gen is pricing out gamers worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Regional pricing sucks. 

\*Used California as an example as i know it has a relatively high tax rate compared to the rest of the USA but i don't fully understand the variation in the USA.

The only time I had a space issue is when I recently tried to install several new games that I wanted to play eventually.  I didn't need them all installed right then, and some of them I still haven't had time to touch yet, and that issue was fixed by simply removing one old game I hadn't played in well over a year.

One of the options being 4k 30 which is a joke for next gen. Although being as the ps5 isnt as strong as a 2080ti i guess it makes sense.",0,0.4,59,2020-09-20 22:21:19
53 Days of Appreciation: Playstation Console Build Quality,MetroidPrimeMaster,"All, I am starting a miniseries of nearly 53 days (or 1272 hours) of Playstation appreciation until the official launch on November 12th.

In your opinion, what Playstation console or variant has the best and worst build quality up until this point?

**Best**: Original Piano Black PS3 - It just screamed luxury and premium quality. A truly beautiful console to look at.

**Worst**: All PS4 builds. They are built superbly well, but I don't like the odd shape choice and the loose plastic buttons that you can find on  nearly variant of the console.

**Afterthoughts**: I actually love the new design choice for the PS5 consoles. It's a pastiche of the 80s Mars colony buildings combined with the look of modern architecture. I think that Sony has recaptured their design magic again.",0,0.42,20,2020-09-20 21:52:18

What other software features should they add on the new OS?

Edit: I know you can do this via Twitch or Youtube. But having a quick sharing feature within a party screen is way quicker and easier than setting up a stream. We use shareplay as a quick share feature where anybody can hop in and out. If you play to stream a game for hours, yes go use twitch",1,0.51,8,2020-09-20 20:39:31
Is God of War sequel in 2021 really too early?,Express_Ad2067,Considering God of War started development in 2014 and released in 2018. That’s a 4 year dev cycle. On top of that if you’ve seen the making of documentary then you might know how chaotic the development of God of War was. The development wasn’t supposed to start till after the new IP Santa Monica was making but it was canned and the entire team was mov d to God of War production prematurely which created a lot pipeline issues with people constantly waiting on someone else to finish something that they needed to finish something else. Not to mention Sony has said they’ve expanded their studios in an attempt to increase the frequency of releases. Given all of that a 3 and half year development time seems plenty for a sequel.,0,0.44,50,2020-09-20 20:34:31

PS Plus Bundle and Remasters,[deleted],"Considering there are 18 games in the bundle, 10 of which are PlayStation exclusives, does this mean those games wont be getting a remaster on PS5? I heard a lot of rumours about a Bloodborne remaster with better framerates, but if its bundled into this collection, then I cant see them making another version on top of this. On the other hand, they want to showcase some of the best games in the PS Plus collection for new players, and nobody wants to play a stuttering 30fps game on their new PS5, so maybe all 18 of these games will get a graphical and frame rate upgrade just for the PS5?

I would have expected a game like Spider-Man to be in this bundle if it wasn't for the fact its being remastered and included in the Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. This could mean games like TLOU2 and Horizon Zero Dawn will be remastered in the future instead of being added to this PS Plus Collection.",0,0.45,12,2020-09-20 17:19:29

I mean seriously. PS4 BC is great. Its an awesome feature. Would i like PS1-2-3 BC? Sure. But its not worth complaining about. If you truly care about old games that much, play them on your old console. All the greats have been or will be remastered. Its clear the PS5 is not for you if you still care about old games.

"Digital Vs Physical Gaming? What should you choose, a little guide by me.",My_Gaming_Companion,"\_\_This is a guide, so best you read it full thoroughly to get some information and some tips. It's for new players or for those who are quite late in PS4 era who are confused deciding whether to buy PS5 digital or PS5 Physical edition? While old PS4 players are also welcomed, who knows what might change your mind?\_\_

Let's get this straight! I will be telling pros and cons of digital games, while cons being obviously pros of physical game. This guide will then proceed forward to next topic of who should switch? Ending with important NOTES.

\*\*Pros:\*\*

\*Digital games are not physical entities, therefore they are damage proof, scratch proof, water-proof, dust-proof, overall they can't be destroyed, which means in case something like natural calamity happens like a earthquake your huge physical library will just came crashing down with all your sweet games discs shattered into pieces (off topic but Nintendo users are safe from most this stuff). While over time your physical games will accumulate scratches and small damages which may render them useless or make them full of problems to play on a console as it couldn't read the disk properly.

\*Digital games are very easy to access. Imagine you want to play all your games just for fun and you have this huge ass physical library. With digital games, and with now the power of PS5 fast SSD you don't have to stand up, and sit down again and again in your couch for changing the disks just exit the game and start next one. Laziness on another level, but that's what every one wants right? But with many games you might end up using HDD which will slow down your load time, but hey! You still haven't stood up from your cozy couch, so it's a win win!

\*Digital games let's you experience a true day one launch. Imagine you have this game (CYBERPUNK 2077) and you are so hype for this you decorated your whole room with posters, changed wallpapers of your devices to that damn beautiful night city and now just waiting for the release to happen. But wait? If you have digital copy, you can just pre load the game on to your console and start playing exactly from the time the game is launched! HYPE ++, but alas you have ordered physical copy, which will take days to come. While all your fav youtubers and friends are enjoying the game while you are sitting and just waiting for your game to come. HYPE : (

\*Digital games go wherever you go! Let's say you are rich af and have over 1000 games in your library, or not so rich but still have a nice 50 games in your library. Now you are going to a vacation for few weeks to a nice spot but don't have enough space to carry all your 1000/50 games with you at once, leaving to you only mere 10-20 games you have. Well Digital games have no problem like that, no matter how many games you have you can take them with your PS5 anywhere and whenever you like, just pick up PS5 and go. (considering you have enough storage solution to store all the games, otherwise you could download them too, I mean not bad considering you don't have to worry about disks right?) Even bad when you are shifting your home you have to take headache of taking them too, and if some mishappening occurs, your disk, well goodbye.

\*\*Cons:\*\* \*Enough I guess, let's make all physical gamers too happy about themselves too!\*

\*Digital games are just yours, which means you can't lend them to your far off friends, and in case you made a bad purchase and refund system is not available or you just don't want that game anymore, well you can't resell them. With digital games your money spent is just spent and you can't get it back anyway , while physical games can be shared, re-sold, and can be given for rent, Overall you can do whatever you want , keep, throw whatever, which means you are in CONTROL! And who doesn't like being in control ?

\*Physical games have not to be downloaded again and again. Imagine you need to download a new game, but you don't have space, and you delete a digital game. But later you got some space and you need to download that 50GB game again. Well congrats! The game you just downloaded before have to be downloaded again with net you paid for. While physical games have no such things. Just insert the disc, download minor updates\*, or hell even start playing without updating the game. No need to worry about deleting a game and thinking you need to download it again. Physical games save so much data for real. (\*doesn't consider updates of modern warfare 2019). And if you live in a bad internet area, then well buying a digital console is just like Going to school without books.

\*Physical games get cheaper faster. So you are not rich af and can't own 1000 games, but you are a gamer by heart and need those sweet juicy exclusives for your ps5, and luckily you are a physical gamer! Well physical games get way faster cheaper than digital ones. Both launch at same prices, but the digital stays on that grossing 60 dollars for months. Even after a year they hardly go below 30 while physical games can be get for like 10-15 dollars from ebay. Now that's what i call a deal!(NOTE: I only took data of around first two years based on my country experience, for more time than this, digital games get way cheaper than their physical brothers most of the time, with few exceptions. Results might differ in your country so see a little statistics of prices of games)

\*Physical games are great for show-off. Now you got some guests in your house, or a annoying child who treats you like shit when you are at his home. They all see your huge gaming library in all it's glory with those physicals cases and those fancy artwork and names written in their spine reading (GRAND THEFT AUTO V). And they all just see that awestruck while you stand their smiling on your beautiful collection. With digital games, meh. If you decided to open your PS5 then it's only possible moreover those fancy cases with artworks and physical items are still no match for those digital photos (it's another level feeling to hold a game in your hands). Physical games are just good for anyone who likes to praise their collection and see them all day and say, it's beautiful, I have seen it for 5 hours now.

\*Physical version doesn't steal your digital fun right? SO yeah by spending 100 more dollars you can get a console that do both physical and digital, and if you are kind of hybrid guy, then this is a extra pros of physical version for everyone.

So that's all I guess. If there are enough please tell me, I will add them here. And I hope that answer much of your questions, so you either have decided till now which is better and what to go with. But you still confused? Well then here comes PS PLUS

\*\*PS PLUS:\*\* I tell you about how good is ps plus actually, consider reading it or skip to conclusion.

\*I intend no console war, these are just my opinion. Xbox game pass is great but that doesn't make PS PLUS weak anyday. Read full.\*

It's a subscription service which gives you 2 free games every month (oof everyone knows that, now's the real deal) For just 60 dollars a year you get 2 top titles to keep every month. Fall Guys, Morder warfare 2 remastered, Street fighter V, PUBG are some of the recent amazing games that this subscription has given. And if you are having this subscription for multiple years like 4 years then you have probably made a 100+ games library which has games even better than whole xbox game pass (except flight sim ofcourse, that game is too amazing imo to be beaten by any PS exclusive). So when you think critically PS PLUS is much more financial and give you much better games than xbox game pass. HOW? LEMME EXPLAIN!

You get two great games, say fall guys, you played it for month and then you get another games while you keep all your previous games. You can continue playing whatever you like. Like this a casual gamer will be happy with these offerings, and don't need to worry about running dry of games, and occasionally you will get top hits like uncharted 4, last of us, or hell even blood borne (GOD OF WAR isn't free until now, so get your damn horses cause it will most probably follow every other exclusive and be free before ragnarok release, only prediction though but quite undeniable). So a see you just pay 300 dollars for 5 years and get over thousands of dollar worth of games while xbox game pass for consoles cost 120 dollars a year(as it cost 10 dollars a month) i.e. 600 dollars for 5 years (holy hell) , with those extra 300 dollars you could buy so great exclusives during sale, while ultimate cost 900 dollars for 5 years . If you don't have pc, then very well, microsoft played you very well (considering some games exit the service too, and xbox live games are so bad most of the games are not even recognizable by many people). And if you have pc powerful enough to play those games, then this is ever better than PS PLUS any day handsdown. In PS PLUS games are being added in your library one by one. Now in xbox game pass they throw all games at once, and as I know you won't be playing every game right? Only 10-20 or ok even till 50. But you still paying for others game you don't play? See the point? That's the secret behind game pass successful model. No console wars here, but to proof that PS PLUS is a very great and financial subscription model for all casual gamers and that many people actually play the game they paid that 60 dollars for. You can buy just exclusives and few other top titles like cyberpunk while all other gaming needs would be fulfilled by a cheap 60 dollars subscription service which grants more than those free games for a whole year wow. See your library once, they are full of gems and you didn't even notice them. PS PLUS is literally a very great subscription service I ever came in hand with considering you not only get free games but other benefits too! (This is all obvious when you see the long run and not short run. This doesn't mean Xbox game pass is bad it's great, but I just wanna prove that PS PLUS is very great subscription model, and I love sony for this as much as I love xbox for their services)

In PS5 you get a PS+ collection which give you instant access to more games, even some you have missed in regular giveaways.

\*\*So after all this we can come to 3 conclusion:\*\* These are my opinion.

1: If you are totally new, then go with digital (but not when you have bad net. No chance. See if you have some cyber cafe or some place with fast net nearby to download games, otherwise you only have one option). Digital is only best option for casual new gamers rightaway. Sure cost of exclusives are 70 dollars? But you can either stick with you PS PLUS games, and wait for a sale, or just buy that yeah. I mean how often are exclusives released? Trust me, PS PLUS games will keep you busy for months and now you have that PS PLUS collection along with free gta online for first free months too! As you are totally new, you probably wanna buy old games which are obviously dead cheap during PS PLUS double discount sales

2: If you are PS4 gamer, and have quite small physical collection and wanna play new games rightaway, then go with digital. Prices are same for both version initially so it wouldn't bother you much. While see how many games you want from you small physical collection, sell all of those and buy digital version on sale (as they will be very cheap now, mostly).

3: If you are either rich af physical guy, or wanna buy exclusives/games for very cheap just after few months of release, go with physical. Although i would suggest try bending towards digital as i don't see physical games working for such huge budget games in future, but as for now, yeah physical PS5 edition is quite viable and you can enjoy them surely for next console genration.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*NOTES:\*\* These are some important thing i wanna share, suggest me more if you think so.

\*DriveClub digital edition is not available. So if you wanna play this game badly, go with physical or just ditch this game for good.

\*With games getting update and patches as big as MODERN WARFARE, moreover blu-ray disk achieving their capacity , it is safe to assume digital media is what everyone have to do mostly. Honestly if you could update modern warfare then you could download any game (except if your intentions are far beyond my imagination)

\*This guide as told was designed for totally new players or quite late players in PS4. Although I have gave conclusion covering as much audience available.

\*Overall you are the one to decide I just given you a direction, but ultimately you have your own decisions so make whatever suits you best. I hope I helped you significantly with this guide.

\*(Physical gamers)Also if the game is asking for mandatory update, try deleting the game, and then open your PS4 offline and then insert disk and start game upon installing. Most of the time it will work, but you just have not to go PS4 online again if you don't wanna update. But if not possible it's probably because of NOTE number 2

\*Don't Buy PSNOW and EAPLAY with PS PLUS at all. PS PLUS is great and you need just time to make a good library. Sony licensing thing is quite messed like PS5 pre-orders, and if some game is given free by EA PLAY or PS NOW, and it was previously given free on PS PLUS, the current license of PSNOW and EA PLAY will override the PS PLUS license and if the games exit the service, there are high chances your PS PLUS library game will also be gone. SO don't buy any other service as it messes all sorts of licensing things.

\*\*EXTRA TIP FOR PLAYERS WHO READ TILL LAST:\*\* Hmm did I wrote this good or you felt click baited?

Ok, now time for a extra tip which is legal (ooh!) and might be life savior. For all you players who read till here, cause that's what heroes do right?

Say you got a whole bunch of library of digital games. But one day you do something and you get permanently banned, and literally you become now broke af, frustrated af, and angry af. But all of that could be prevented, if you did this one thing.

First of all make two legal accounts on PSN (by legal I mean everything you enter should be 100% accurate and no faking of anything, seriously). One with which you purchase games, and another with which you will play games now. Log both accounts in to your PS4. Now with you main account, buy games , PS PLUS membership and set it as primary. And with your play account play your games. Now if you get banned you will lose all your game progress. But hey those sweet games and your PS PLUS library are still saved in your another account right? Make another account and play your games (again from starting though, rip my 2000 hours in SKRIM)

However I honestly condemn racial shit and slurs, in online gaming. If you do it, you are the lowest scum in this earth. However I found out this method because company can ban you many times for no obvious reason, and then we have nothing to do except remorse.

So this was my method, it's working great from 2 years for me. And it will do so cause it's not illegal to buy games in an account and don't play it in it lol? And hope this method will make you feel more good about buying digital games, as it was considered one of the biggest problems of digital gaming, that your whole library is r/whoooshed if you get banned. That's why I didn't state it as a pros or con, cause here is the solution (for anyone wondering). And save files are lost both in physical and digital method as they are tied to your account.

So that's it all I had to share. I hope it was much helpful for you, and I hope you have a great next gen gaming experience. Was having free time so decided to spend it by helping others.

It's nice to see some level of commitment to having these sort of games on the system and putting them in the forefront. So often it feels like  the Nintendo console is the only place to go for this in a generation. I can remember there being a lot of big games like this in the PS1/2 era, but as time has gone on, the ps3/4 trended more adult in what they were pushing.

Does the PS5 launch remind you of the PS2?,MetroidPrimeMaster,"Does anyone else get that weird, nostalgic feeling from the days of the PS2 launch? I remember growing up the PS2 was so elusive and wanted because it literally did everything (playing DVDs). While 4K Blu-ray isn't as big compared to media 20 years ago, Sony is literally using the same advertising tactics and marketing push for the PS5. I have to say, it's got me quite excited as a whole.

While I have always liked other consoles and handhelds too, Sony has a penchant for hitting the right marketing notes. 

Does anyone else feel the same?",27,0.7,19,2020-09-19 20:18:21
"PSVR might not work with the new PS5 HD camera, so maybe keep hold of your old PS4 camera.",BitcoinBoffin,"As the old saying goes: ""To assume is to make an ass of u &amp; me."" So forgive me if I've assumed others have just maybe missed the finer details on Playstation Cameras, HD or otherwise as I think I have.

According to a careful reading of the [accessories section on Sony's own PS5 page](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/ps5/accessories/) it details the new PS5 ""HD camera"" with zero mention of it's use with PSVR. However immediately below the link that takes you to the [PS5 HD camera's own page (which also has zero mention of it's use with PSVR)](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/accessories/hd-camera/) is the following text: 


""PlayStation®Camera adaptor

Connect your PlayStation®VR to your PS5 console to enjoy supported PS VR games. To set up your PS VR with your PS5 console you'll need your PlayStation Camera* for PS4™ and a PlayStation Camera adaptor (no purchase necessary). More details on how to claim an adaptor will be shared on PlayStation.com when available.

This will be unfortunate if it turns out to be correct as I was hoping the higher 1080x1920 resolution PS5 HD camera might go some of the way to help to resolve PSVR's tracking &amp; jutter issues.

If you are going to be using your PSVR with your new PS5, keep hold of your PS4 camera in case the new PS5 camera is incompatible with PSVR.",18,0.69,25,2020-09-19 20:11:42

The PS5 launch will be the biggest launch in PlayStation history,DJ_Binding,"With the PlayStation 5 releasing in less than two months now, I think we should start looking at the games that we'll be playing out the box. These are the games built for PS5 available launch day:

* Assassin's Creed: Valhalla
* Astro's Playroom
* Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
* Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition
* Demon's Souls
* Destruction AllStars
* Fortnite
* Godfall
* Marvel's Avengers
* Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales
* Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered
* Observer: System Redux
* Sackboy: A Big Adventure
* Watch Dogs: Legion

That's 14 games right there, but then if you add the PS4 games confirmed to be released at launch through the PlayStation Plus collection, you can add these:

* Batman: Arkham Knight
* Battlefield 1
* Bloodborne
* Days Gone
* Detroit: Become Human
* Fallout 4
* Final Fantasy 15
* God of War
* Infamous: Second Son
* The Last Guardian
* The Last of Us Remastered
* Monster Hunter: World
* Mortal Kombat X
* Persona 5
* Ratchet &amp; Clank
* Resident Evil: biohazard
* Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
* Until Dawn

That is a total of 32 games confirmed to be available launch day. For comparison, the PS1 had 11 launch titles in the US, the PS2 had 28 launch titles in the US, the PS3 had 13 launch titles in the US, and the PS4 had 22 launch titles in the US.

While backwards compatibility info is sparse, it's possible that if the backwards compatibility is available at full by launch, the PS5 will have nearly 2,900 games available to play at launch.

"PS5 does not ship with TOSLink. This is potentially a problem, but I have a solution.",CataclysmZA,"I haven't seen anyone discussing this recently, or going anywhere with analysis on the ports. I'm going to be mainly discussing the issue of the missing TOSLink connector, but I will highlight two other points. 

#Firstly, the figure-8 power cable. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320

Previous console releases saw launch PS3 and PS4 consoles use what's commonly (and incorrectly) called a kettle cord. The connector is actually part of the IEC 60320 standard for electrical connections. Some people associate its use with lower-power devices.

On the launch PS3, Sony used the C14 inlet design, which is pretty popular with PSU vendors for PCs (among other things like audio equipment). For the PS4 and PS4 Pro, Sony switched to the C18 plug. This has compatibility with C13 cables, and the ratings are just about the same. The only physical difference is that the plug was not designed to be rewirable and it lacks an earth pin.

Later consoles like the PS3 Slim, the PS3 with the sliding tray, and the PS4 Slim all use the C8 inlet connector. The notable difference is that it is only rated for 2.5A power draws by the IEC. Some vendors will exceed this spec and draw up to 10A, but the use of C8 is attractive because it doesn't have a polarity requirement. Sony has chosen wisely because they can use the smaller connector and still be within the IEC spec to power the PS5.

2.5 Amps at 120V is 300 Watts. Similarly, 1.25Amps at 240V is also 300 Watts. Use of the C8 inlet connector is perfectly in line with the expected 250W power draw of this console. Xbox Series S and X also make use of the C8 connector, which is a nice way to cut down on waste plastic, and the console ends up being slimmer.

~~Also, this practically means that both PS5 and the Xbox Series S and X will ship with a power brick.~~ It doesn't, actually. Ignore my dumbassed comment on this one. I wrote all this at 1AM.

#Next, the hidden SSD bay.

https://imgur.com/MeagAc1

In hands-on time with the dummy Xbox Series S, you may have noticed that the unit has holes drilled above the SSD cart slot. The Series X doesn't need this, as there are already gigantic vents above the slot for the split motherboard design. 

Where would the PS5 put them? On the bottom. In the render that we saw this week, there are two sets of vents on the bottom of the console. One has a blanked-out port that is clearly meant to accommodate the same size SSD carts as the Xbox Series S and X. The second set of vents might be there just to pull in some air over the power circuitry. This means that closing off these vents is a big no-no.

https://imgur.com/8gO3Ke1

In fact, looking at the stand for the PS5 you can clearly see that it raises the console off the ground with a wide gap for fresh air intake, and it forms a tunnel underneath the console. The rear shot shows the stand rising up to meet the back of the chassis where it clearly clips on, and the rear of the stand is also open. Good ventilation is key for SSD longevity, so keep this in mind when you're shoving your expensive toy into a closet.

Edit: Regulatory filings have pictures of the bottom, and there is no SSD bay. There are still vents, but my speculation was incorrect on this one. 

#But let's talk about TOSLink.

https://imgur.com/JlPTouV

[The Series X had TOSLink.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/esa8nq/xbox_series_x_rear_port_setup_revealed_in_new/) You can see it right there next to the USB ports on the leaked prototypes. [It's not on the Series S](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21865124/twarren_200908_4177_0005.0.jpg), presumably to help meet the lower cost threshold.

PS5 likely never had it. This is a minor headache for anyone who owns a speaker set that isn't acting as a receiver for their surround sound. I don't know what most of r/PS5 owns, but Sony clearly thinks that most people will just plug the console via HDMI into the TV and job done. But how will anyone that doesn't have a receiver that does HDMI Passthru hook up the console to their surround sound?

Most TVs can fill a room with sound, but it's invariably awful quality. Some of you might be snazzy enough to own a TV with a matching sound bar, or a reciever which is HDMI 2.1 capable and HDCP 2.2 compatible. But in the spirit of not adding to electronic waste, I now have to look around for a rather expensive HDMI-to-TOSLink splitter (at almost 10% of the cost of a PS5 with shipping). Most of the cheaper commercially available units aren't HDCP 2.2 compatible, and they have to be powered. And there are compatibility problems. 

For example, Astro now has to bundle in a compatible splitter with their headsets for PS5 [that they designed](https://www.destructoid.com/stories/here-s-how-your-astro-gaming-headsets-will-work-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-601913.phtml). This is because most cheap, commercially available splitters do not properly support Dolby 5.1 or Dolby Digital Plus, even if it says it does on the box. Better still, many of these devices don't pass through HDMI signaling without some issue like monitor flickering, or FreeSync not working, or converting a 4K signal down to 4:2:2 instead of passing through 4:4:4 because there's not enough bandwidth available (which also affects HDR support).

Truth be told, a lot of receivers with HDMI passthru don't handle this well either. Some of them have an HDMI CEC implementation that is buggy and doesn't pass through ARC audio correctly, others will break HDCP and drop to a lower version of the standard. Separating the audio outputs makes sense given how disjointed HDMI is generally.

But I don't know why they had to make their own when there are commercial options out there. Maybe they really mean they just rebranded a Kanex Pro?

This one might do the trick for my setup, as well as most others: https://www.kanexpro.com/item/?id=HAECOAX3. But don't think of it as a splitter, because that's the wrong term for what's actually going on here - it's extracting audio from an HDMI signal and simultaneously outputing it to whatever else supports audio input. There's still sound being transmitted via HDMI. This is more like a vampire tap that allegedly does not break HDCP.

So if you're using an older audio setup and plan to buy one of the new consoles - hopefully a PS5 - you can still use your older TOSLink cables just fine so long as you plan for purchasing another dohickey to make the old thing work with the new thing. This should also allow older high-end wireless headsets that uses the optical out on PS3 and PS4 to continue working.",0,0.47,36,2020-09-19 15:08:30

Less waiting during fast travel isn't a gameplay feature that will alter your moment-to-moment experience. It cannot do so by design so that PS4 players get a similar experience.

Only Ratchet and Clank seems to be attempting anything tied to the PS5, but to be honest the implementation there is also disappointing in my opinion. All sequences where you're hopping between dimensions seem (at least for now) highly scripted and on-rails. Visually, they're great and interesting, but the gameplay would be the same if you weren't hopping around between dimensions. The ""grapple"" item is also very disappointing. It offers no new utility from any item that could pull you from point A to point B like a Zelda hookshot.

PSA: US folks looking to monitor stock can use NamePromo to get notifications,FuriousBrad,"For those in the US who are still trying to preorder, I recommend NamePromo.

"Hate to Break It to Everyone, Due to Pandemic, Deliveries in the US Will Be Delayed for Many Regardless of Source (Amazon or Otherwise)",vgskid,"I have made plenty of online orders for things from furniture to toys to video games to computer hardware, etc. (I moved homes right before the pandemic hit). The last 4 months, I’d say a majority of my orders made it to me late from Amazon, UPS, FedEx and USPS even on overnight or two day shipping. 

I was so frustrated one day a couple months ago after waiting 6 extra days for a UPS shipment (even after their app kept telling me today’s the day everyday!), and I saw the UPS truck deliver something next door. I ran out, and I was very nice, but I was like please tell me what’s going on my stuff keeps delivering so late. He said ever since the pandemic hit and with people are working from home, the delivery volume has been like Christmas time ALL THE TIME. They’re extremely overwhelmed. 

Meanwhile, right now, I’m waiting for a bed frame and it’s 16 days late from FedEx. Talking to multiple people at FedEx and they’ll tell you the same thing UPS said, they’re overwhelmed and making a ton of mistakes. So you just gotta be patient. 

The reality is the pandemic isn’t going anywhere. We haven’t made any real plans to handle the virus since it started and a vaccine isn’t coming until next year. That means people will have to continue to work from home and go to school from home and will continue to overwhelm all delivery companies. Amazon is just smart enough to get ahead of it now.

There will be more preorders for launch and here's why,HansomeChris,"Little bit of maths and theory around this so grab your hats

EB Games sold out their 75,000 PS5 allocation in 1hr in Australia. Preorders for JB HIFI, Big W and Harvey Norman are also sold out awaiting Sony's next allocation of stock with no timeline suggested to date.

Ignoring Amazon and Sony's allocations, let's go through the maths based of the $50 preorder charge each of those stores requested when ordering:

75000 units X 4 suppliers X $50aus = $15,000,000

If the stores give all of their $50 booking fees to Sony (unlikely but for the sake of argument), Sony has acquired $15 million from Australia alone to secure future deliveries of PS5s for the region.


I'll bet that although the first preorders were crazy and unorganised, Sony is using these new funds to resupply the demand, and more launch day preorders will be available and accessible to (almost) everyone.

That's my hope anyway",0,0.29,5,2020-09-19 09:10:28

COD Cold War Opens your eyes to what the “Next Gen” enhancements truly are.,raw272,"Playing the COD Cold War Alpha is a very good way of opening your eyes to how lighting and reflections will make the game look “next gen”. Seeing the trailers and PS5 gameplay, the game is stunning with Reflections in the right places and lighting just right, while when playing the Alpha it shows how obvious it is that it’s missing these next gen features. Jumping into the Alpha I was actually surprised to how much that actually improves the experience and “immersion” as a whole due to the alpha not being able to show these features on console. Seeing the floors as a reflective surface but no reflections is something I never really noticed in COD before but seeing the PS5 event backed up by the Alpha opened my eyes to how much better a game can look with these elements.

One thing I hope Sony sticks with is announcing their games closer to launch and trying to surprise us with release dates for those games.,TooDrunkToTalk,"It's gotten kind of lost in the pre-order mess but I still can't quite get over the fact that 5 of the 9 first party titles announced in June will release day 1 on PS5. That is amazing.

Same with the fact that R&amp;C is coming ""launch window"" and that a God of War sequel is, for now, slated for next year.

What's really cool about this, aside from those games being close, is that it breaks with the traditional expectation we have for Sony games taking years to come out after their announcement, especially when they get announced with no release window. How often did I read between June and now that the PS5 only had Spider-Man for launch and that all those other games could release who knows when? Now all of these preconceptions are out the window and I kind of love it and hope it continues like that.

When Horizon FW was announced for 2021, the internet was full of snarky comments about how that would actually mean 2022. But now? Who knows maybe the game is targeting summer or even spring. It's a cross gen title after all.

What about Returnal? Or GT7? After the suprises from this week they could release as early as next spring and I wouldn't be shocked.

Maybe there are even more games planned for next year that they just didn't announce yet.

There's something exciting about the idea of being able to start a year without knowing 100% what games you will be able to play by the end of it and I hope Sony is able and willing to continue this trend they've now started with the PS5.",160,0.87,31,2020-09-19 05:46:29

Anyone else see Sony hinting towards the future of PSnow with PS+ collection?,MitchyPower,"For a while now there have been rumours that the PSnow service may be thrown into a combo pack with PSplus, or even be added to the existing subscription.  Hell, a lot of the games they  announced in this collection are already in PSnow.

Fuel has recently been added to this fire by the PS+ collection... pretty much doing what the PSnow games do. While this could potentially be just an added extra for people buying PS+ at launch, similar to how Nintendo gave out a bunch of GBA games to early 3DS owners, it could also be the first step in marrying the 2 services. 

Love PSnow or hate it, but it has numerous flaws. Such as inferior versions of games like the PS3 edition of Shadow of colossus instead of the PS4's being on there, the nathan drake collection not being on there but the PS3 edition being there, and the same goes for the Last of Us. There is also no PS1 support, PS3 games can't be downloaded like PS2 and 4 can and so on and so forth

By rebranding and folding this into the existing subscritpiton, or even having it be an extension to PSplus, we could see Sony rectify some of these unfortunate downsides of PSnow as it currently stands.",13,0.63,19,2020-09-19 04:36:55

Guide for people who're planning to buy Cyberpunk 2077 and are wondering which hardware or next gen console to chose on launch day.,Fisher992,"\- If you have RTX cards, choose PC all the way. Game will support DLSS, which mean you can play kinda-4k with much higher FPS

\- If you have potato PC (like GTX950), choose PS5. Game will be at least PS4 pro version on PS5, we just don't know what kind of improvements we'll get from day one - but I assume that would be better textures, bigger resolution, 60 FPS. The ""robust"" upgrade in 2021 will probably include better optimization, even better textures and ray tracing (and maybe support for haptics and 3d audio)

\- If you are in my position (medium ranged non-RTX PC, 1660 super, Ryzen 5 3600), then it's a bit...harder choice. The game may look better on your PC on launch, but in long term it'll surely look much, much better on PS5. Unfortunately, you're gonna have to wait few months or year for that. So:

\---&gt; If you plan to play it only once, choose your PC. But note that the game will get free upgrades, DLCs and multiplayer during it's life cycle.

\---&gt; If you plan to play the shit out of this game more than once, choose PS5. Your first playthrough may be worse in terms of aesthetics, but next ones gonna support Ray Tracing and awesome (hopefully) optimization. With PS5 specs, I'm sure the game will look almost as awesome as on trailers.

The reason why exclsives are 70 dollars instead of 60.,Real_Mousse_3566,"This may not be completely accurate but I think I know the reason why sony is charging 70 dollars (note that this is speculation based on statements made by people related to PS5 and its games). On 17th of September Jim Ryan, the CEO of playstation said that “The PS5 versions of those games (cross gen games) are built from the ground up to take advantage of the PS5 feature set, and we have an upgrade path for PS4 users to get the PS5 versions for free. It’s about people having choice. I’m really quite pleased about the situation.” 

Now we all know that when it comes to cross gen games that you make the game for the current gen system and then scale it up to the next gen system but however if what he says is true then insomniac and gurella are making two versions of each game separately, a ps4 version and a ps5 version that’s apparently built from the “ground up” for the ps5. Doesn’t this imply that these devs have to do more compex things like change the design of the game instead of simply scaling it up for the PS5 which is no doubt more cheaper then what Ryan has described? They are probably charging 70 dollars because they spent a ton of money making both versions of these games like this.",0,0.15,67,2020-09-18 23:09:21

Thoughts on game edition consoles...,Fish-With-Pants,I wonder if Sony is going to steer away from making game edition consoles and instead sell game edition panels. I feel like they’d sell a lot more Miles Morales or God of War themed panels/sides than they would sell consoles. Especially if they are selling consoles for a loss (I’m not sure if they are or not that’s just what I heard) but they definitely wouldn’t be selling those panels for a loss. But people would def end up buying multiple panels. I know I’d be more inclined to buy 5-10 panels than I would to buy even one PS5 *insert game here* Edition.

First let me say that is not 100% confirmed that when you log into your PS5 you'll magically have every thing from PS4 available. However, I think safe bet. I'd hope Sony wouldn't take the time to promote backwards compatibility while failing to mention, ""hey but you have to start new saves.""

For those that don't know you can save your game saves onto USB device or upload to cloud storage. Getting it to the cloud for now is the most important piece. Here is how.

You can also have this auto upload to cloud going forward...Only caveat is you have to be the Primary Console on a PS4 system with PS Plus.  Now we don't know the Dashboard of PS5 yet but the following is what you would do to get your data from the cloud onto the PS4's storage.

Screen capture/game recording predictions?,Famsys,"Personally I think it might be able to capture at least 1080p at 60. Maybe it will have a higher bitrate than the PS4 so the image is cleaner. Also it would be neat to be able to capture at 4K30 or maybe 1440p 30. The higher amount of ram and overall better specs should allow this. Might we might  see 720p 120fps?. It would be really nice but I doubt that'll happen

I don't know if HDR capture is a thing but it would be nice if possible. Again I don't know if it is.

What do you all think of what the screen recording can do? I hope it's better than what the PS4 has but not by much. Obviously a dedicated screen capture card is better since it doesn't need the consoles power to capture so it can capture much higher quality video. A lower bitrate/higher compression is important for console's built in screen capture so it doesn't take up too much space.",0,0.29,7,2020-09-18 19:26:16

"Is anyone concerned/curious about Destruction All Stars? It’s a launch game and we haven’t seen much of it. I’m a little wary of this one, especially at $70!",Rogue_Leader_X,"We saw a brief trailer for this at the PS5 reveal, but since then? We’ve seen squat! Seems kind of ironic and weird that with DSA and Demons Souls  both being launch titles, we’ve seen less of these two games than we have games coming out AFTER launch like Ratchet and Clank:RA and Deathloop. 

However, with Demons Souls it’s more understandable why we haven’t seen so much of the game, as after all, it’s a remake and most people who haven’t played the original are familiar with what’s Souls games are like. With Destruction All Stars we really know very little of this. Also, they are charging a full premium $70 price point for this thing. That seems really expensive given the game looks like a mostly online focused affair. Does the game even have a single player campaign? I really hope Sony sheds some more light on this one in the coming weeks. Sony really should given us even a brief gameplay demonstration at the event on the 16th. I REALLY THINK they could’ve skipped showing stuff like DMC5, Fortnite, and above all Five Nights At Freddys to allocate the time to show this game off.

The Potential design of Cross Gen games moving into this generation.,theyungscrawnybones,"As many of you know, Sony plans to release PS4 versions of Spiderman: Miles Morales and Horizon: Forbidden West. Now with the announcement of these a storm of controversy surrounding these two titles sprouted about how they will hold back the potential scope of these games, which is where I have this question. Do you guys think Sony built two separate distinct versions of the games with the PS5 versions having extra mechanics in game due to the upgraded specs and not just a boost in the visuals department. For example, say in Miles Morales the swinging speed was capped in the PS4 version due to hardware limitations but in the PS5 version it wasn’t (A very arbitrary idea but plausible nonetheless). Or how about there being flying machines in Forbidden West that you can interact with on the PS5 version but not on the last gen version. I know this all may be wishful thinking, but I’m really just hoping the scope of these games wasn’t limited and that the PS4 versions were more afterthought that Sony thought they could capitalize on with the large install base. I still do think it is a really nice gesture to provide these games to late adopters to the platform, but I just want these games to be the best they can be gameplay wise. Graphically, we can already see they are with that stunning Miles Morales footage but is there more to it than that? What do you guys think?

Those buttons really are a gamechanger, not just for competitive games, but also a huge source of comfort/convenience in single player games.

I really thought that Sony releasing the back button attachment for the Dualshock 4 meant that PS5 controllers would see these buttons becoming standard. But doesn't look like that's gonna be the case. 

Hopefully Sony can fix this issue by releasing a pro version of the Dualsense controller with back buttons, or at least licensing the design out so that third party companies can make one.",27,0.6,69,2020-09-18 11:59:50

Weird flex but okay,Mexicancocoroach69,"That was a surprise. At least for me. It would make sense for a AAA title that is good and doesn’t have micro transactions. Demon’s souls is an example. There’s only two ps5 exclusives that are currently 70$. Demon’s souls and destruction all stars. Now demon’s souls? I get it why it’s 70$ and that’s fair. But destruction all stars? Why? I don’t understand. It should be at least worth 30$. I don’t care about the pricing of games in the US, but what about Canada and Europe? The gamers cost 90$. That’s a lot. Something feels wrong...is it because of the economy? Pandemic? I need answers!",0,0.35,71,2020-09-18 07:45:08
You should be pisses at the journalists for misleading readers re: cross gen games,WileECoyoteGenius,"[The Jim Ryan article in question](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-29-sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5)

**The Claim:** There will be no cross gen games.

&gt; One way to keep PS4 users engaged would be to make upcoming PS5 games playable on the older machine, just like Microsoft is proposing with its Xbox Series X games being playable on Xbox One. **Yet Ryan says that's not something PlayStation is interested in doing.**

Ryan's quotes on the PS4:

&gt; **""We have always felt that we had a responsibility to serve that [PS4] community for several years after the launch of PS5 and that it represented a huge business opportunity for us**,"" Ryan says. ""The numbers are quite straightforward. If you say in broad brush figures that we have a community of 100 million PS4 owners right now, and in the first couple of years... I don't know, somewhere between 15 and 25 million might migrate to PS5, that still leaves a huge number of people with PS4s. And that community is demonstrating an amazing stickiness, and willingness to stay engaged that, I think, the events of the past few months have just reinforced what we knew already.

On PS5:

&gt; ""We have always said that we believe in generations. We believe that **when you go to all the trouble of creating a next-gen console, that it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include.** And that, in our view, people should make games that can make the most of those features.

&gt; ""We do believe in generations, and whether it's **the DualSense controller, whether it's the 3D audio, whether it's the multiple ways that the SSD can be used**... we are thinking that it is time to give the PlayStation community something new, something different, that can really only be enjoyed on PS5.""

When he spoke about believing in generations he did not mention anything about no cross gen games. He was clearly talking about adding new features that comes with every new console.

He did not mention that Playstation is not interested in cross-gen games. The article writer implied it with no reason.

He specifically mentions supporting the PS4 and userbase after PS5 launch.

The article writer, and subsequent journalists basing it on this article have clearly misinterpreted (deliberately or not) what he said.",29,0.55,132,2020-09-18 07:44:47
What's the first PS4 game you are going to put in the PS5 and hope it had backwards compatibility?,nippysaurus,I'm thinking probably Red Dead Redemption 2. So many good options though. I'm also keen to try Doom 2016 just to play it without the console sounding like it's about to take off 🙂,105,0.87,266,2020-09-18 07:43:46

Is 4K really a must when playing ps5?,Quirky_Image_5598,If I do play games like spider man is 4K going to make the game way better or is 1080p good enough. I’ve got a 1080p monitor so and I’m not really a specs guy.,19,0.69,115,2020-09-18 07:41:39
At what point would a second DualSense be usable,Sextus_,"If DualShock4 is only meant to work for PS4 games on the PS5, does this mean it will work for those PS+ local multiplayer games like Mortal Kombat X? So what game is coming out that we would need to get a second DualSense for local multiplayer?",8,0.63,34,2020-09-18 07:38:52
