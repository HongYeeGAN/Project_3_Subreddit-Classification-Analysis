I know I must not be alone in this basic request to be able to change my account store.

Quick question. Is there any word on PS4 peripherals working on a ps5?,B1ackMagix,"So truth be told, I've strongly been considering getting out of the console market now for quite some time. I love my switch however the PS4 is sitting on my shelf almost entirely unused. With exclusives releasing on PC more and more, I just don't have a reason to continue to fund my PS4 with one exception. Gran Turismo is a series I love and have put many hundred hours in.   
  
This brings me to my question. With the new Gran Turismo releasing on PS5, will the current gen of periphials, (steering wheels, rudder pedals, etc.) work on a ps5? I'm really not willing to re-buy a whole new setup when truth be told, the components have no problems.  
  
I understand there are some hardware differences between the ps5 and ps4 but my understand is both are still using the x86_64 architecture with a standard usb interface, wouldn't that lend itself to ps4 usb controllers working on ps5?",0,0.13,6,2020-10-01 20:27:44

Kena Bridge of Spirits article one of the Game Informer staff got a hands on with actual PS5 hardware. He said he seen glimpse of the UI before the developer scrolled over the Kena game icon and hit play. 

He said the game loaded from PS5 Menu to gameplay in 2 Seconds. That's astounding. That's not loading into game seeing Menu then hitting play. That's hitting play from PS5 UI to game. 2 Seconds. Insane. 

This is probably old news but had to share anyway.


From Article

We start PS5s menu screen. Before I can see to much Mike moves over to the Kena Icon selects it and presses play. Two seconds later we're in the game. That's the load Josh says perhaps sensing my astonishment. They have a whole thing set up where you can do transitions and it's very nice,but frankly it doesn't have time to play the animation he adds.

Help me understand Ray Tracing (Spider-Man PS4 remastered) Honest question.,K3v1n777," I'm not a pc gamer, so I'm not used to Ray Tracing. 

So from what I heard and know, Ray Tracing allow light to better reflects on surface and to create better reflection. (I can be wrong) 

And as you all know, today this photo of Spider-Man Ps4 remastered came to life. 

[https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv](https://prnt.sc/uqwfqv)

But I feel like there's something wrong.

With how high Peter is and that camera angle, is that normal to see all the street and the pedestrians below him? 

And also is Ray Tracing supposed to be ""like a mirror""? I mean is it supposed to have a 100% reflection of what is on the other side/angle? Is it too exaggerated in the photo or is this really what is Ray Tracing? 

I feel like this is just because it's the beggining of it on consoles so Devs doesn't have a standpoint (except on Pc)

Could we see a digital trade in option in console gaming's future?,caveman512,"It's not something I expect to see with this generation, but as consumers become more and more digital I fully expect in a generation or two to see consoles go the route of Digital Only.

With that in mind, I've thought about the possibility of the PS Store some time down the line offering trade ins. You buy a game at $70, and after you've decided you won't get any use out of it you have an option to delete it from your account forever for a small credit to the PS Store of like $10 or whatever.

The potential PS4-PS5 save transfer issue.,Wreck1ess,"""Fair warning. This is going to be weirder that usual.""

So hear me out. I have been paying attention to this Yakuza issue with ps4 saves not transferring to ps5 and it seems it may not be the only game having this problem and by ommission and assumptions it's gone unnoticed.

I have to think that the issue has to be a technical one. There's no way an rpg that is crossplay wouldn't want to be cross-save as well. That makes me nervous about other games like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk that are also crossplay.

Control got heat for only allowing the Ultimate edition to upgrade, but what if they knew the older version's saves wouldn't transfer either. Also the Spider-man remaster won't allow save transfer as well. So that's three.

I am no tech guy and this may be the concerns of an overthinker, but it bares considering that saves may not be as easy to transfer from one system to the other this time.

It could explain the new crunch time situation at CDPR after they promised they wouldn't. If they hit a snag like this they would grind their way to a solution (or they just told people what they wanted to hear).",0,0.38,13,2020-10-01 02:24:27

First-Party Titles Run At 4K@30 or Dynamic 4K@60?,King_A_Acumen,"So on the Spider-Man Remastered page, it says, [Link](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered/);

&gt;Experience the critically acclaimed hit with updated graphical assets and in stunning dynamic 4K/HDR\*. And experience swinging through New York and combat as an experienced Spider-Man with an optional performance mode that takes advantage of Insomniac’s temporal injection for dynamic 4K/60fps\*.

We have also been told that;

&gt;and the same optional performance mode offered on Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, allowing you to finally play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate.

We also know that Demon's Souls, at least in the trailer, according to DF was rendering internally at 1440p and then upscaled to 4K so basically Dynamic 4K right?

Does this mean that in quality mode the games will run at 4K@30fps with ray-tracing and in performance mode, it will run in Dynamic 4K@60fps without downgrading graphical fidelity so raytracing still on?

Even if it is up to the dev, it seems that Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Demon's Souls will have these 2 choices, they seem to be using Insomniac's Temporal Injection method,

&gt;which takes a lower internal resolution and uses prior/upcoming frames as well as AA to fill in the details to get a 4K image. It's another way of upscaling, like checkerboarding is, but temporal injection gives a cleaner image. Before DLSS 2.0 it was probably the best quality upscaling method.

1440p 60fps is the way to go next gen,PizzaManNintendo,"Hear me out before keyboard warrioring please.

I've noticed a trend where 4K 60fps games as well as 4K 30fps games look like current gen visually(as in texture quality and the overall look of a game, not resolution). Examples of this are Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Godfall, Final Fantasy 16, Kena Bridge of spirits, Spider Man: Miles Morales and Halo Infinite. On the other hand you have very few games that genuinely look next gen. Like a handful at most. And one of these games is confirmed to run at 1440p(Demon Souls remake). Then you also have the unreal engine 5 tech demo(not a game but it still counts) which also runs at 1440p. The only other two I can think of is horizon forbidden west and black myth wukong. The former will probably be 4K 30fps knowing Sony but its going to be cross gen so a lot of power can be devoted to realistic graphics since its basically going to be an amped up version of a PS4 game. As for the latter, we do know that is 60fps and seems very unlikely to run at 4K on console judging by how advanced the graphics look compared to other next gen games. If games which look like PS4 games are bottlenecked at 4K 30 or 4K 60 there's no way in hell Black Myth Wukong can run 4K 60 so its most likely 1440p 60 like the tech demo and demon souls remake. 

Anyway, the bottom line is for a game to actually look like a genuine next gen game it has to be 1440p or sacrifice other areas like frame rate as well as being very limited in size which would be a huge turn off for some gamers such as myself who prioritise frame rate over resolution. 

1440p is a perfect compromise. 4K is a monolithic leap that is really unnecessary. Usually each gen the jump tends to be around 300p. PS1 to PS2 was 144p to 480p which is just over 300p. PS2 to PS3 was 480 to 720p which is a 240p jump. PS3 to PS4 was 720 to 1080p jump so 360p. If we go from 1080p to 1440p that would still be an above average leap at 360p difference. We all noticed the sharp resolution quality increase when we switched from 3 to 4 so why wouldn't the same happen with 1440p. 4K on the other hand is excessive. Why jump 1080 pixels all of a sudden? Not only is this uncalled for but like I said, it also sacrifices frame rate and ultimately weakens the graphical quality of games by using so much of the GPU's power so that the actual graphical quality of games look like last gen. 1440p 60fps is a much more well rounded solution that benefits everyone and is more beneficial towards both graphics and gameplay. Besides a needlessly large jump in resolution that people will get used to pretty quickly, there is nothing to lose from this.

I’m not a big fan of the Netflix-like subscription model for games.

Maybe it’s just me or how I treat video games as a form of entertainment.

I just can’t invest my time in a mediocre game and have fun. There’s nothing worse than playing a bad game. 

There are some occasional big games added to the library and majority of the users seem to be waiting only for those. And this seriously raises doubts about the value for money aspect with these subscription models.

Rise Gamers! Turkish Gamers are in a very bad situation. Please help us to get regional pricing,pikachu11111,"Hi. Let me get straight to the point. I am asking for the help of all gamers around the world so Turkish Playstation users can also enjoy the great exclusives you guys do.  
  
Playstation Turkey recently increased the prices of some games to enormous amounts. For example, the new Avengers game costs 679 Turkish liras (87 US $) or Need for Speed Heat costs 709 Turkish liras (91 US $). So with these prices, we can only buy 3 games if we save all of our monthly minimum wage (2.324 Turkish liras). Let me also add that lots of people in Turkey earn a minimum wage because there is a  lack of jobs, even people who graduate from universities could end up in a minimum wage job which is not enough for anything.   
  
Let me also add that, this economical situation of our country is of course not the problem of Sony. We are also people just like you, I may or not support this goverment but I have the right to enjoy games as much as other people from other contries do. Just because I am born in this country, should not mean that I should not enjoy the things that you guys do. Other companies help with their pricing so we can also play games but Sony does not. For example 20$ indie games cost around 32 Turkish Liras on Steam so we can also enjoy them. Another example for Steam could be Cyberpunk 2077 costing 249 turkish liras. With these pricing examples, we can afford them by saving money for a few weeks/months. Microsoft also offers us Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for 45 Turkish Liras a month so we can enjoy as much as you guys do.  
  
But when it comes to Sony, they don't do anything. I also want to enjoy the new upcoming God of War Ragnarok or the new Demon's Souls but at this rate they are going to cost 800-900 turkish liras which is far from affordable. And even worse the PS5 is probably going to cost arond 8000 Turkish Liras (1020 US$) because of the heavy taxes of our country.  
  
What I am asking from Sony is to give Turkish players a regional pricing. If they don't want this because of the abuse that other gamers from other countries can do (buying from us because its cheaper) they could make it so that only people with Turkish ID's would be able to buy from the Turkish store.  
  
And from you guys and girls, from you fellow Gamers. I am asking for your support. Please support us so we can also enjoy that new God of War game, even that cute Bugsnax game together. I don't want to be forced to wait for the hope of getting these new games on ps plus when they come to that service 4 years later.

"It seems that playing video games early has a great positive effect onto your memory, says this neuroscience study. So ready for the PS5?",Cr8CPU,"While a number of studies have shown that video games can cause structural or functional changes in the brain, including the activation of areas responsible for attention or spatial and visual skills, this new work reveals lasting beneficial effects on memory when practiced in childhood. A recent study from Neuroscience researchers of the University of Barcelona finds that playing video games during childhood improves memory sustainably.

Study is available here: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235/full)

This new research, was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and involving 27 subjects between the ages of 18 and 40, showed that beneficial cognitive changes could occur years after giving up playing games. video games.

I game since my very young age of 6, i can confirm that my memory still works fine at 40+. 

What about you? Did you start gaming long time ago? Are you going to start with PS5? Do you think that these studies should enable governments to support gaming better? Let's maybe having a super ministry/secretary (in US) of Sport and eSport? or of Video Games? (seriously...)

A lot of talk about the SSD recently,FTerrier17,"The SSD, I know for launch games it will load games almost instantly but I'm wondering down the line, when we get to the back end of the generation will developers be able to eat up this quick load time to the point we experience load times as they are now or is this not possible? 

I understand that they wouldn't want to, but I'm not sure if it was possible, that as the games they make get more demanding and as they try to squeeze every last bit out of the system to make what they are trying to achieve, that the SSD can't keep up to the point we get back to longer load times again. I only say this because it's like on any new system, it starts out fast but as time goes on it starts to get slower to the point where menus are a bit more laggy etc.",0,0.45,70,2020-09-29 18:20:00

Comparing the performance of PS5 to the PS4 in 2013. What do you guys think how PS5 will perform throughout its life cycle?,Loldimorti,"So this is more of a technical discussion I guess. I've been thinking a bit about the PS4 lately in an effort to understand how the PS5s life cycle may play out.

And basically three major questions have emerged:

1. was the PS4 really underpowered when it launched?

2. How come resolution and framerate didn't really get worse throughout its life cycle even as games became more visually impressive?

3. What does that mean for PS5?

I'd like to give my own two cents on this but I'm very curious to hear your takes on this since I most propably missed some stuff.

Was the PS4 underpowered? Looking back at 2013 I don't actually think it was. But the specs were certainly less impressive than PS5 today. Everyone (me included) constantly trashes PS4s CPU but at launch it was propably somewhere around Intel i3. Not too bad. The 1.84tf wasn't too bad either. Definitely not high end but still mid range. The 8gb of DDR5 on the other hand were really impressive. This was during a time when we were debating wether you needed 2gb of video RAM. All in all I'd say PS4 was a mid range system compared to PS5 which sits in the higher mid range.

So why did resolution and framerate not get worse over time? Especially during the Xbox360/PS3 era there was a clear trend towards games performing worse later in the generation. In 2006/7 you'd actually see some 720p 60fps AAA titles. Later on it was more like 540p25fps.

This didn't really happen for PS4 though and I don't really have an answer for that. At launch most PS4 games were ~900p 30fps and I can't say it has gotten much worse over time. In fact during 2015 I'd say performance actually got better with lots of games hitting 1080p30fps or 900p60fps. I don't really have an answer for this one since PS4 didn't have a super complex architecture that would have required years of experience to unlock its power. My guess is that games didn't get that much more demanding with PC gamers pushing towards higher framerates rather than visuals (judging from the slow adoption of ray tracing for example). This generation didn't really have a Crysis that completely blew away the status quo.

Now to my final question. What does that mean for PS5? While PS5 is more powerful than PS4 was back in the day I'm not sure wether it is actually in a better spot.

If the life cycle does in fact turn out similarly to PS5 I think the status quo will be 4K 60fps without ray tracing and 30fps with ray tracing. However the UE5 demo from this summer tells a different story. It was super impressive but only ran at 1440p 30fps. I could imagine a fully fledged game of that caliber being even more demanding. In that case I think it is absolutely crucial that PS5 has a decent upscaling solution so they can reconstruct a low res image to something that at least resembles 4K resolution. Otherwise I fear we will see the issue where lots of games will be ""dynamic 4K 30fps"" but will dip wayy below 4K most of the time, resulting in a really unstable image that would oftentimes not hold up on a 4K display.

What do you guys think about this? Did I miss something? Did I get something wrong? What's your take on PS4s performance throughout its life cycle and how do you anticipate PS5 will compare?",1,0.51,73,2020-09-29 16:35:51

The amount of platformers revealed to be on the PS5 is such a refreshing thing,OxEagle19,"Anyone else noticed that on that last PS direct and both PS5 showcases that there were barely any first-person shooters? The variety of games on there is so damn nice, it shows a commitment of appealing to as many tastes as possible despite Call of Duty and Sports titles being the kinds of games that sell the most. The PS5 couldn’t get here any sooner, I can barely hold my excitement! Also, what launch titles do you guys plan on getting? I keep seeing Demon’s Souls and Miles Morales but Sackboy and Destruction All-Stars gets no love, I have a feeling that Destruction All-Stars is going to be a sleeper hit and Sackboy: A Big Adventure is also refreshing especially since LittleBigPlanet is my favorite PS3 game of all time.

I hope the tradition for PS4 exclusives to have incredible soundtracks carries over to the PS5,Kennett-Ny,"I've only had a PS4, none of the PlayStation's before, so I'm only judging on the current gen of exclusives.

I personally think that the current gen PS exclusives have had some of, if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard in games. So I hope that the PS5 exclusives will continue having incredible soundtracks. 

Most of the time I'd say there's a couples tracks from each album that I'd listen outside of the game, but when I was making a Spotify playlist with game music. I ended up just adding pretty much all of the album. Especially Marvel's Spider-Man &amp; Detroit Become Human (I know it's not exclusive any more)

I hope PS5 will be available in store on launch,LambdaPro,"PS4 on launch was a nightmare in Toronto. My brother and I traveled all around different parts of the city and it was sold out everywhere.

Seems like Sony’s collaboration with AMD may have been successful,Aclysmic,"I’ve seen quite few people speculating this in r/AMD 

[*Road to PS5 Presentation Mark Cerny says*](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=1564) - “If you see a similar discrete GPU available as a PC card at roughly the same time as we release our console, that means our collaboration with AMD succeeded.”

**Among other cards Navi 22 has been shown in a recent [leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j06xcd/number_of_cus_of_navi_23_navi_31_van_gogh_cezanne/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to have 40 CUs @ 2.5 GHz which is very similar to the PS5 GPU (36 CUs @ 2.23 GHz). PS5 has 90% of the CUs and 90% of the clockspeed.** 🤔

Does that mean he was likely referring to Navi 22 and the collaboration was successful? Maybe we’ll hear more in AMD’s upcoming event next month.

I hope PS5 will allow us to do this.(regarding save scumming),iHelghan,"on PS4 if you want to back up a save to USB you have to close the game to do the back up task, that's really irritating especially when you go after 2 or more conflicting Trophies (i.e. Endings) or when forging an equipment which have RNG skills and you are looking for a specific skill on that equipment until you're running out of resources if you didn't get what you want you can go to your backed up save. i know PS5 can boot up games fast and i'll be where i left the game in few seconds after backing up my save but still doing that without shutting down the game is more convenient for us Save-Scummers.

PS5 checkerboard rendering?,CasketGymnastics,"With Digital Foundry's recent analysis of Demons Souls indicating a 1440p/60fps rendering target, it occurred to me that I don't recall hearing (and haven't been able to uncover) anything about a native checkerboarding solution for PS5. For those unaware, the PS4 Pro had dedicated hardware to interpolate and fill in missing pixels from incomplete 4K frames using previous frames (aka ""checkerboard rendering""), giving a much better visual approximation of 4K than upscaling, but without the performance cost of native 4K.

It seemed logical that Demon's Souls could *possibly* target a CB4k/60fps display if Sony has included similar checkerboarding hardware in the PS5. A partial 1920x2160 frame (whose missing 1920 horizontal pixels could be CB'ed to complete a full 4K frame) does contain 12% more pixels than a native 1440p one (4,147,200 pixels vs 3,686,400), but that does put it at least potentially within optimization reach for Demon's Souls. I would consider this somewhat unlikely for Demon's, given that Bluepoint is on record as preferring the simpler approach of temporal injection of 1440p into a 4K framebuffer in the Shadow of the Colossus remaster. Regardless, having the option of checkerboarding on the PS5 could put higher-detail performance modes within reach of many future titles, rather than forcing a strict compromise of ""performance = 1440p, detail = 4K"".

I can see why Sony might not have drawn attention to checkerboarding with the PS5, as it would likely stoke fanboy allegations of the console being too weak for ""real 4K"" etc, but given how well it was implemented in the PS4 Pro, it's hard for me to imagine them excluding it for any reason other than the already high expense of the hardware. I know there are robust software-based checkerboarding solutions out there, and 1440p titles from last-gen like Uncharted 4 / LL and TLoU2 did really well with their overall image quality and detail. But for me the PS4 Pro really proved that checkerboarding is the best technology outside of DLSS for getting high detail at a low performance cost, and if a game could offer me CB4K/60fps vs 1440p/60fps, I'd choose the former almost every time.",18,0.69,77,2020-09-28 13:15:08

Game boost mode for ps4 games,densetsu86,"Ok I think I finally understand the confusion around the road to ps5 when mark cerny was talking about the top 100 games ranked by game time and the 99% BC.

With seeing the playstation.com landing page for ps5 theres a feature called Game boost. With that it fixes the confusion with what mark cerny was saying.

At launch there will be about 100 ps4 games that will support Game boost mode. Basically running ps4 games using non-legacy mode. Making full use of ps5 raw power.

At 28:02 from road to ps5:

&gt;Running ps4 and ps4 pro with boosted frequency has also added complexity. The boost is truly massive this time around and some game code just cant handle it. Testing has to be done on a title by title basis. Results are excellent though. We recently took a look at the top 100 title as ranked by play time and were expecting almost all of them be playable at launch on ps5.

He was not talking about BC but Game boost mode for ps4 titles. 

That's a huge fucking announcement that got obscured due to not understanding what he was talking about at the time due to missing info.

PS concerning the flair, I don't really think this is specualtion but more of a realization and confirmation that most didn't pick up on yet.",164,0.87,123,2020-09-28 08:17:41

My little brother and I picking our jaws up off of the floor when we experienced the first few minutes of Devil May Cry on our PS2 on Christmas morning having never experienced graphics like that on a console before. The two of us huddled under our covers absolutely terrified during a 2 AM session of resident evil or silent hill.

As I mentioned before, now that I’m a dad and don’t have nearly as much time to devote to playing video games as I would like. That said, as I look back, there are a few titles that I would collectively lose my shit over and make the time to play through if they happened to find their way onto the newest generation of consoles. 

**SSX Tricky**- The original and subsequent follow ups to the series definitely did a great job showcasing the capabilities of that generation of consoles however SSX Tricky brought the beautiful graphics head to head with incredibly satisfying and completely outrageous over the top game physics while adding its own unique brand of humor, customization, and addictive leveling system, all while stringing together ridiculous over the top superhuman trick combinations not seen since the days of Tony Hawk Pro skater. 

To see this title brought to the next generation of consoles with a graphical overhaul, and dear god just imagine what could be done with the haptic feedback of the new PS5 controllers. Imagine how addictively satisfying it would feel to push off a jump and feel the snap or pop of the board or literally feeling the powder crunch underfoot after landing a ridiculously sweet combo... there’s just so much potential hear it makes me a little crazy. 

**Oddworld: Strangers Wrath** - I can’t honestly remember how I stumbled across this game but it was one that I feel didn’t quite get the praise in attention it deserved. I could be wrong about this, perhaps that was just my perception, but I was left so satisfied after playing through this title. How seamlessly they were able to blend third person  3D platformer and first person shooter was just incredible. And the fact that you could almost play through the entire game using one or the other speaks volumes. The humor laced throughout, the creativity of “live ammunition“, and with a fantastic storyline to boot, this is one of those titles that genuinely left me sad upon completion as I just simply didn’t want it to end.

**Tiger Woods circa early-mid 2000s** - Damn was this title addictive. I know they are still pumping out titles but they are just not the same. No it wasn’t a ridiculously realistic golf simulator and that’s what made it great. The injection of and well balanced mix of arcade style gameplay and simulation, incredibly satisfying and addictive swing mechanics, silly customizations, and the genuinely hilarious in game commentary from David Feherdy &amp; Gary McCord made these titles so much damn fun. Nothing since has quite been able to capture the magic this series once had. They need to ease up on the simulation and inject a hint more of the arcade style shenanigans. Bring this series back to its glory days! Hell you didn’t even have to like golf to enjoy those games. 

Wipeout - I mean come on this game is PlayStation. Nough said.

Twisted metal - “Ehem” See above.

New studio acquisitions,Mockzer0,"With Microsoft's 7.5 BILLION dollar purchase of Zenimax/Bethesda, I have seen a lot of articles and podcast talking about what studios Sony can buy in response. When I think about it, I would hope that if Sony has money stashed away for these type of acquisitions it would be better spent on creating new studios.
First off, a new studio would cost significantly less than buying established IP. Some of them are outlandish propositions people were putting out would have Sony buying Square Enix (valued around 6.8 billion) and even ubisoft (valued at 10.5 billion). Even if you consider a more realistic acquisition like From Soft(which is tied up under a much larger parent company) or Platinum, you are still talking about very expensive deals.
You could build new mid-sized (70 people) studios for approximately $25 - 35 million (salary + overhead) for the three to four years they would need to start self sustaining with revenue.
What if they started four of them!
They would come with the benefit of creating even more diversity that we would get to play.
I would be far less excited for them to buy an existing studio that already was planning on putting their games on PlayStation.
Just my two cents, but when I thought about that 7.5 billion dollar number, I immediately started thinking about how many new studios Microsoft could have created instead.",0,0.24,73,2020-09-27 23:16:46

PS5 just went Super Saiyan. 17.38 GB/s is mind blowingly fast!,Aclysmic,"A couple days ago we found out that with [Oodle Kraken and Oodle Texture](https://wccftech.com/ps5-io-system-to-be-supercharged-by-oodle-texture-bandwidth-goes-up-to-17-38gb-s/) the PS5 is capable of 17.38 GB/s which is just mind boggling. Nearly 2x the speed of what we once thought beforehand. That already beats RTX IO which caught everyone by surprise when Nvidia unveiled the new RTX 3000 cards and PS5 once again dusts the PC space with its insane speeds. 

Though Mark Cerny in the Road to PS5 presentation did state that the PS5 has a theoretical max of 22 GB/s which a lot of people seem to have overlooked. With Mark Cerny’s efforts developers will be able to truly meet their vision in games for next generation. Mark Cerny is truly an amazing console architect and imho one of Sony’s most valuable assets.

I just wanted to shed some more light on this because I don’t think a lot of people realize just how fast this is. I just think that this huge boost in speed will open the door to much more amazing and beautiful looking first party games with even bigger worlds and even more detailed environments than previously imagined for next generation.",7181,0.87,1811,2020-09-27 11:35:41

Disappointing UK/PAL Box Art News: PS5 to KEEP the PS4 plain white text spine art for Sony games,MitchyPower,"When we got box art for Miles Morales in PAL territories, we saw that it had a logo on the side, something that almost never happens for Sony first party pal games... Apart from Spiderman. It led many of us to hope that this would carry over to all next gen first party titles. We had also theorised that perhaps it was just for Spiderman so it would look similar to the first game's, as it appeared to be replicating the box art too.

Unfortunately, that is not the case (pun not intended). The box art for Sackboy has been revealed, and it has the cursed plain white text on it's spine

If you are wondering the meaning of this, [I made a more detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/iei649/a_european_uk_wish_for_ps5/) about this back when we got that news, complete with pics for non-PAL readers

But I'll give you a brief summary

* If you buy a PAL First party sony game, you get a generic white/black text on the spine of the box. This alone wouldn't be a problem, as the PS2 in Europe had it, and it's quite aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that it is ONLY Sony games with this, instead of everyone like for the PS2. This leaves your collection on your shelf looking like a collection of games, and pirated movies you bought in a foreign country on your vacation.

I was personally holding out hope for some change this generation, but it looks like I am going o have to look into the custom covers/slipcover community to fix this unfortunate reality

This is especially disappointing, as Sony promised a more global approach this generation, but this notion seems to have been just PR speak.

FAQs

&gt;I like the plain text on the PS2!

As do I, but it needs to be all or nothing. All logos, or all plain, it makes some look like lazy knock offs if they're alone

&gt;Why do you care so much?

As a physical owner, I like being able to look on a shelf and seeing the game's I've sunk many hours into. 99.99% of the time, I will finish a game, and then it will sit on the shelf. Is it that wrong to care for how a display piece looks?

&gt;Just use the alternate cover!

I would... if we got those. Most PAL territories get health warnings on the inside cover instead of the reversible covers found on Spiderman and God of War

&gt;Just Print out the US one!

Also not an option, as Sony doesn't put these scans up for Piracy reasons, meaning that if you get one it's a user's own scan, which are far from a good quality. Or you have to import an empty case, which starts to stack up as a costly endeavour if you're replacing a dozen first party games

&gt;First World problem much?

You're right, but Gaming is a first world pastime. If I am spending as much as I am on a game, it's not unreasonable to have packaging that looks good.

&gt;OCD?

No, just have a shelf, like that shelf, want to have some consistency in the games on that shelf",0,0.41,9,2020-09-27 05:53:37

Because I know this will be a low availability item, here are my tips on how I got mine and how the wait for it was even more bearable.

1. If it’s been announced that there will be some in-store, call them and get as much concrete information as you can. Find out how many they’ll have available, if it’s okay to start a line overnight, what they’re store hours are, etc.

2. The most important thing you need to know about camping overnight for a console is that you need to have the guts and determination to do so. Don’t show up at 6AM thinking that you’re going to get one, because trust me, there WILL be people who are more determined to secure a console than that. In New York for the Nintendo Switch, there are people who would wait literally 2 days straight to be first in line to get theirs and to meet Reggie and Doug Bowser. Even if you live in a small town, be ready to get there at least 8-9 hours early. I live in a small town and I showed up at 5AM and I was the last one at my GameStop to get a PS5, but not too much longer after I arrived there were waves of people showing up, so I got very lucky and showed up at the perfect time. There were 5 PS5’s available, the first guy showed up at 1AM, 2 guys showed up at 2AM, the 4th guy showed up around 3AM, and I showed up at 5AM. Do not rely on living in a small town to guarantee that there will be any available because news gets around fast thanks to the internet.

3. Alongside determination, a lot of people just simply don’t have the time to camp outside stores like that due to having to work, take care of kids, etc. The only reason you should make room for doing something like this is if you are really determined to get up really early and commit to waiting for it, don’t think you can squeeze it in without making room in your schedule for it.

4. Befriend the people you are waiting in line with. It’s going to be a long wait, and how much these people are willing to be cordial with you is really what’s going to determine if the wait is going to be agonizing or fly right by you. Bring multiple chairs, one for yourself and some to offer others should they forget to bring one due to them rushing over to the store and forget to bring their own. If you want, be willing to buy or offer them some snacks and drinks, and most importantly, set up this bond that ensures that everyone waiting there will have each other’s backs should anyone need to use the bathroom. Joke around, engage in conversation, and be charismatic to make sure everyone feels comfortable with you. You’re all going to be waiting at least 6+ hours together after all, no reason to let things be awkward. And believe me, everyone will want to, no one wants to sit there for hours next to a guy who’s unfriendly and keeps to himself the entire time. 

5. This actually brings me to having to use the restroom or wanting to get something to eat. If you do leave, depending on how big the line is, don’t be gone for too long, 15-30 minutes tops. You just look like a dick being gone for so long lol, and it’ll be awkward for everyone else saving your seat. Now, if you have a friend or relative who’s willing to drive to your location or wait with you then that’s awesome, but if you don’t just make sure you don’t take too long.

6. My final tip is actually for before you have decided whether or not to go through with waiting in line for a long time. I’ll say this, I wasn’t going to go either, but something just told me “fuck it, if there aren’t any then just go back home”, but I’m telling you, that feeling of knowing that you absolutely will get your console, all you need to do is wait, it will HEAVILY outweigh any doubts you have about waiting anymore, you’ll be too happy to even care lol.

And there ya go! And remember if you aren’t able to secure a PS5, eventually you won’t be able to go into a large retailer without seeing them everywhere, so don’t lose sleep over it. Good luck to you all!

EDIT: Also, one thing I can’t believe I forgot but should be taken very seriously when deciding whether or not to wait in line, make sure to bring comfortable clothing and check you’re local weather! Bring completely charged electronics &amp; of course wear your masks!",678,0.82,291,2020-09-27 05:16:02
What We Do &amp; Do Not Know About The Playstation 5,thechickenskull,"Updated 27 Sept with some of your comments.

Just thinking aloud here, I figured we could chronicle some of the known and still-unknown topics about the Playstation 5.  Perhaps we could update this document as new details emerge.  Feel free to chime in on items I've missed. 


#Things We Do Know

Just a modest list of things of which we are certain.

##*How Will Backwards Compatibility Work?*

&gt;99% of Playstation 4 games will be playable on the Playstation 5. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/))

&gt;The exact list is not currently known, though it's likely that any games that require specific peripherals (or something like that).  

&gt;It should go without saying that if you have a Playstation 4 disc, you *will not* be able to play it on a Playstation 5 Digital Edition.  

&gt;As for Playstation 3, 2 and 1 - none of these platforms are currently supported by backwards compatibility (except through current PS Now. 

&gt;Will all these games be available at launch? Another mystery! 


##*Which PS4 Games Will Have Available Upgrades For The PS5?*

&gt;[Push Square has a good list](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/ps4-to-ps5-all-games-with-confirmed-free-upgrades).  This shows which games have free upgrades and what those details are.

##*And What About Controller Backwards Compatibility*

&gt;Playstation 4 controllers *will* work with the PS5.  However, they will *only* work with PS4 games.

&gt;For all Playstation 5 games (currently known), a DualSense (i.e. PS5) controller is required.

&gt;Will Playstation 5 controllers (DualSense) work on Playstation 4 games?  Currently unknown.

##*Will PS VR Work With PS5?*
&gt;Yes.  It will, however, require some sort of dongle adapter.  That adapter will be free, but [we don't know how to obtain that or how it works](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/ps4s_camera_will_require_a_free_adaptor_for_ps5).


#Things We Still Do Not Know

I look forward to learning more to make this list diminish over time.  

##*Video Output: 1080/1440/4k*

&gt;Both Microsoft and Sony have touted 4K visuals but many don't have TVs supporting this.  Will games be available in 1440P?  We're not really sure, and I think this will work on a per-game basis (i.e. up to the developers).

&gt;The reason this is a question (for those curious) is that many people play on monitors rather than TVs.  In addition, while the PS5 *can* offer 4k @ 120hz, very few TVs offer this.  1440P @ 120hz is more common.  We're just waiting for Sony to confirm what's what here.

##*Will We Be Able To Suspend Games?*
&gt;One of my favorite PS4 features is the ability to put sleep mode and return to a game quickly later.  The newest Xboxes will be able to suspend more than one game at a time.  Sony hasn't mentioned anything about this feature on the PS5.

##*How will Playstation Plus work?*

&gt;This will likely work as it has in the past: two free games for each system.  Cloud saves and online multiplayer will be locked to the service.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The PS Plus Collection will be a great perk for owners/subscribers, offering at least 18 games for download.  [[More Info on the PS Plus Collection Here](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-collection-games-on-ps5)]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But beyond this, we don't know if any other changes will be made.  Pricing should remain the same.


&amp;nbsp;

##*How will PS4 save games carry over?*


&gt;Best guess?  Cloud-based saves should be automatically detected by the Playstation 5 and downloaded accordingly.  

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For remastered games (currently *Spider-Man*, perhaps others), save games **do not carry over**.  For PS4 games,   

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will we be able to move save games from PS4 -&gt; USB -&gt;PS5?


##*Will PS Now see any changes?*

&gt;They've told us very little about PS Now, but they *will not* be moving towards a model like Microsoft's Game Pass.  New games will not be available through this service and no new titles will be added to it for the PS5's launch.  [More info here](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amp/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console)

##*Will You Be Able To Activate A PS4 And PS5 Simultaneously?*
&gt;This is a unique one.  With games being available on both, Sony *may* not allow this to happen.  A quick example would be me selling my PS4 because I have a PS5, however my old console is still activated as my primary device.  The new owner could use all of my games despite not having purchased them.  

&gt;This is why I think you'll have to deactivate your old device - but that's just a guess.",138,0.86,169,2020-09-27 04:57:26
Sony should make PS5 UI like their phone UI. Customizable home screen and app drawer.,youriqis20pointslow,"PS4's current UI is a disaster, especially if you have a lot of games.  They should adopt a ui similar to phones, with customizable home screen, an easily accessible app drawer, and a home and multitasking button.  The current UI tries to reinvent the wheel and makes things overly complicated.",0,0.29,10,2020-09-27 04:52:13
What Is do you think biggest advancement from ps4 to ps5 out of all of these?,FeelingBasket,"We got ray tracing 

We got a Much better cpu 

We got a ssd 

Dual sense (controllers) 

Better graphics (1.8 ps4, ps5 10)

I want to see people open up their PS5,Dangelouss,"I'm curious to see the internal differences between the digital and the disc versions. I opened up my PS4 last week and the disc unit is massive and now I'm wondering what implications/benefits its absence could bring to a console. Smaller, more efficient or quieter fan, smaller power unit, ease to clean up is what I can think of without much effort.

Who else wishes for Sony to have diverse genre of games instead of just story driven third person games?,solicited_nuke,"As great the story driven games of PS4 are, I wish there were more variety in first party lineup. The games are getting more samey and I am sure I'd eventually get bored of them just like I got bored of Assassins Creed Series and Gears series.

There are no first party multiplayer heavy FPS game, similar to Halo. 

No RPG like BOTW. The only good open world first person RPG Elder Scrolls is supposedly not coming to PS5 and Avowed is the only game that seems to be falling under the same category, which is also again not coming to PS5.

There are no first party arcade racers or cart racers like Forza Horizon or Mario Kart.

 There are no 2D platforming like Ori or Donkey Kong. 

No turn based strategy game like Mario Rabbid or Gears Tactics. 

No game to play and chill with friends, similar to Animals Crossing or Sea Of Thieves.

 No fighting game like Smash Bros or Killer Instinct.

 No RTS like Halo Wars or AoE. 

I might have missed some as well. 

I own every hit PS4 exclusive but I have only played them once. I wish we had more genre of games with more replayability and variety. With new gen of games getting even more expensive, I just wish we had more replayability. I am kind of getting bored of samey looking third person action adventure games.",0,0.44,37,2020-09-27 01:51:09

Sony Gathering Information About PSVR and Gaming Habits,FN2187theTr-8r,"I got a lengthy survey from Sony today that took about 10 minutes.
Basically, they were asking me my thoughts on VR, if I owned a PSVR, if I still play it, and why/why not.

They also asked 'What is the most important: gaming on a dedicated device, or being able to play games across multiple devices.'

Very interesting. Could Sony be thinking about opening game streaming to phones like Microsoft is doing? Or perhaps the next PSVR will be open and let you use it with other devices (phones, computers, tablets, etc)?

What are your thoughts?

"Sony's PS5 ""Gamer Feel"" + Wipeout 4, Motorstorm, Knack 3, The Order?",backupaccount12411,"**From** PS1 to PS4, Sony have been there for us as gamers. From the feel-good moments  (""$299!"") &amp; the success taking on the Nintendo 64 &amp; Sega Saturn Juggernauts, Sony started strong.

By the time the PS3 had really hit its stride, with fantastic first party studio acquisitions and partnerships like Naughty Dog, From Software, and Media Molecule, I've always felt that despite owning multiple consoles &amp; PCs, Sony earnt my loyalty.

There have been some tough moments on PS4 (lacking wishlists, playtime, easy internal media storage, and no backwards compatibility through emulation of our PS1/PS2 collections, among others) but we've always been able to count on Sony to treat us like gamers and not insult the value of our time, bringing us first-party experiences like no other, and sharing it with PC &amp; other console brethren when possible. **So thank you Sony**, for bringing up welling excitement with the PS5 like never  before.

**To the point of this post**. There are a few franchises which are difficult to imagine life without, however it feels like too long already. Sony, can you bring us these, in some form or another? Or will they forever languish, lost to competing interests or past memories?

\-**Wipeout Series**. On all Sony consoles, there has been that reliable ultra-fast anti-grav racing experience. The thrill of modern hard electronica thudding through our brains, whilst the blood heats in our veins, has been a fantastic thing to enjoy since the one I began with, Wipeout 2097 (XL for NTSC partiers). It furthered a lifelong love of sensory overload and thumping breaks/d&amp;b. Will it come to PS5? Every month without an announcement is torturous, and surely others feel the same.

\-**Motorstorm Series**. More metal &amp; grunge than anything, and channelling Road Rash, Twisted Metal, and Carmageddon all at the same time, again with the aural overload that brings home the bass. As an Aussie, the locales often dug deep into that need to explore the unknown, and one misses it every day since a very first 720p game on the Fat PS3.

\-**Knack 3**. As someone who likes to look nothing up about games before immersing myself in the world, and after finishing the first knack with a partner, and finally getting around to the second most recently, it was very surprising to learn that the first was moderately well-received, and the second just so slightly more. No other game series, as someone who grew up in the '90s, has been able to put such a feeling of wondrous youth and excitement as an adult. 

**Knack 1 &amp; 2 were** **that** **feeling** of waking up at 5 am, sneaking into the TV room with a blanket, and watching Saturday morning cartoons - but this time, as an adult, with a significant other! That feeling is priceless, in a world where many have lost their ""wonder &amp; magic"" feelings to the prey of a quick, endlessly unsatisfying slot machine-type loop. 

\-**The Order: 1886**. This was a wonderfully cerebral take on the most detailed steampunk city that I've witnessed. The story was gripping, the combat was thrilling, and of course, there was no sequel or mention, after the mediocre reviews ripped it apart for being ""boring, unambitious, not next-gen, a glorified walking simulator"". I am sad to think that this franchise isn't given wings (or perhaps the figurative wings it has been given are the wrong ones?).

\-**PT.** Please. Make it so. The masses have spoken.

So, In conclusion to this essay-length feature, for anyone that made it this far, is a request to SIE to keep valuing our intelligence, and especially those of us that don't have the money but spend it anyway, because we continue to trust in your expertise as gamers and successful innovators.

And to developers that work with Sony: keep producing wonderful works. Resist the temptation to fall prey to companies who have a history of buying and running talented studios into the ground. Push back when the execs tell you that it's not a winning proposition, despite the rich history and worlds you've built. Don't take the easy monetization route, or one that compromises your ability to reach us Single-player experience-based gamers, because in this day and age, when some of us desperately need another world to be transported away to, we don't want to worry whether that world will be there for us in the future. There's enough of that already in real life.",4,0.58,23,2020-09-26 15:22:49

Tempest and 360 reality audio,JonTheWong,"I’m looking for a headset to replace my BT JBL headset that I use for PS4 wired and on my many other devices. 

I have my eye on the Sony WH1000xm4/b

https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4

They list 360 reality audio on a chipset and the PS has the tempest engine chipset so I was wondering how compatible would it/could it be?

Based on PS5 wireless chipset they support BT 5.1 and ideally will support BT headsets but I’m ok with wired. 

My long winded question is; would this be a good choice?

I’m not interested in having two headsets hence why i don’t have the gold/platinum ps4 ones.

What kind of game is missing from Sony’s first party lineup of games?,DigiQuip,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the games Sony has in the oven ready to go over the next few years. They have a really wide variety of incredibly successful franchises and I don’t think there’s a lot of worry about whether the PS5 will struggle to find enough titles that by themselves will sell consoles. But where’s their weakness? What genre is leaving the biggest hole in Sony Studios first party lineup?

There are a few areas I think Sony could stand to invest in. First, is a military shooter. Maybe not first person, but something heavily combat focused with multiplayer potential. I’m sure the Crist thought goes right to SOCOM, as it should. People have been asking for a reboot for a while now and it’s for good reason. SOCOM was a tight, tactical shooter that gave many players their first taste of online multiplayer. It would do well with a reboot and could solidify the PS5 as the complete console package. 

The second area Sony should look into is a bit ambitious. But a 100+ hour open world game like The Witcher or Red Dead or even Assassin’s Creed would be something gamers could find themselves buying a console just to play. What I mean by this is a huge open world game that keeps players invested in the world and experiences long after the main story is complete. Sony has explored open world style games with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and most recently with Ghost of Tushima. This has extra implication because Xbox has the Bethesda, the undisputed king of making open world epics. 

Finally, Sony needs a sci-fi game. I don’t really know where on the spectrum of sci-s game needs to fall but with Killzone on the shelf collecting dust something needs to take its place. An argument could be made that Horizon meets the sci-fi criteria but I’m looking more in the realm of aliens, space ships, and energy weapons. It’s a hard genre to perfect but when you do it right it has lasting potential in the world of gaming. I think Sony could see this lasting potential turn into a large adoption of consoles.",3,0.56,70,2020-09-26 09:55:06

Jokes aside, Sony really needs to start working on this. Back when I created my US account Brazil wasn't even an option and then it took them 10 years to finally launch the store here (and with only a few games at first). 

The expensive dollar to reals right now and the overall economy makes it pretty difficult to buy stuff off my US account. I'd love to finally be able to buy stuff on my own currency.

Before anyone tell me to just create a new account I really don't want to. I have a whole life with my main US account, loads of games and DLCs, thousand of trophies and more than 100 friends.

I'm Worried the PS5 UI Will Launch With a Lot of Missing Features (Similar to PS3 and PS4) Your Thoughts?,talhindi416,"So if you all recall, the PS3 and especially PS4 user interfaces were lacking in a lot of features upon the launch of the respective consoles. For example, both consoles got **themes and background customization support** a lot further down the road. (I always found it weird that even though themes were very much a  thing on PS3, they weren't a thing on PS4 at all until I think about a year into the console's life.

PS4, specifically, got the following features and some others that I'm probably forgetting about a number of years after the console launched: **(folders, quick menu support, online/offline appearance, etc.)**

Sony knows that all these features and more are the kinds of things we expect from the start of a generation at this point. Since they're basically ""quid pro quo"" features for any good UI nowadays. But going off of their track record, I am just concerned we'll be missing a lot of these cool features come November 12th. Keep in mind, I have no idea of the complexities of UI development and don't want to undermine the hard work I'm sure they're putting into the UI.

Transportability of the PS5?,Ricecookerx,"Hey, I know this is technically another one of those PS5 vs PS4 pro threads, but my question is sort of specific so I couldn't really find an answer to my question on the countless other threads.

That reasoning is pushing me to lean towards the ps4 pro since its a little bit smaller. Just curious to other peoples thoughts on that.

"I don't like the idea of Sony buying, konami, capcom or square enix, or any other big publisher.",ronbeef1kg20pesos,"I have a few  opinions that i want to talk about, hope this post doesn't get deleted

I think nurturing studios is the good way, the way sony did so far,  what microsoft did is just throw money at zenimax and that's it. Is funny how Microsoft hasn't even talked about games that much, all of their doing so far is litetally just throwing money with cheap gamepass service and buying a big publisher.

What i want to say with this is, Sony so far has shown more games (let the games do the talking) and a lot of users seems to forget that the most important part of a service or games  is to have good things to go for, i know gamepass has good games but honestly i don't think all worth paying a monthly fee, a lot are praising gamepass, praising microsoft buying zenimax, which in my mind is bad for all of us, on top of this, MS still hasn't showed or proved that their are going to have a good line up so far.
I know you may say ""but they bought several good team developers by buying zenimax"" well that's true, but we still have not seen any in regards of this, no games, no nada yet.

I think Sony still have a very solid games lineup, strong enough to convince anyone to have a ps5, just don't forget that games are what important most of anything else in this business.

Edit:

some more thoughts

I think MS is not competing, they want to take over the market with brute force (aka money)

Something that im questioning my self too

What would avoid MS to buy a lot more third party publishers, like take two or ea, or ubisoft, in lets say 5-7 years?
It will not be fair to us users having MS locking all of the third party gaming publishers for the sake of ""being competitive""

If i had money to spare i would be beting that this is how microsoft is going to compete from now on until they get most of the share of the market and then to fully become a monopoly, if they succeed.

A Case for Remakes.,GMoneyChuck89,"I don't know if I am in the minority here, but I am loving this new boom of video game remakes. Sure, it can be seen as lazy to just give an old game a new can of paint and sell it off to us for nostalgia reasons, but I'm actually excited about that.

As a movie buff, I am always interested in remakes, seeing how a different director puts his vision into a known project. I guess the same thing pertains to games. I want to see how my old favorites would look with modern graphics. Plus, with recent remakes, they feel like entirely new games (FF7 remake), despite being the same subject material.

So, are there any old games you'd love to see remade? I'd love to see Dead Space make a return. Although looking at it now, the lighting is ahead of its time by a mile, it would be nice to see it with crazy graphics. And the 3D sound? Mah Gahd. Also, next gen damage models for the nechromorphs would look beautiful. And maybe F.E.A.R.? Maybe I just want a resurgence in action horror.",28,0.69,65,2020-09-26 03:23:31

Unanswered questions regarding the Playstation 5,Aratrax,"I apologize for my bad english.   
This  is not about anwering my ""questions"" but more about the fact that many things are still unknown. All these things can change the opinion on the Playstation 5 drastically. 

The PS5 release date and price are finally public (or atleast for more than a week). Some people were lucky enough and managed to pre-order a Playstation 5 and many people were not. I was lucky enough and managed to grab a launch day PS5 Disk Preorder. Since that day I've been unpatiently counting down the days 'till I can get my hands on that beautiful piece of tech.

And yet there are some questions that are floating in my mind.

**What is the noise level of the Playstation 5?**The Playstation 4 was known for its bad cooling system and loud fans and I'm worried that the PS5 will be the continuation of this story. Sony already announced that they invested a huge amount of money into the development of a good cooling solution but there is always a fine line between marketing babble and facts. I for my part did not own a PS4 (I switched to PC) and can't judge it for myself but I'm still worried.

**Why is sony still so vague about backwards compability?**I know, I know... Sony already announced that many games PS4 games will be playable on the PS5 but I'm still wondering how PS5 digital users will be able to do so. Sony is still really vague and I'm worried that there will be on or another catch. Microsoft really did a good job and made everything quite clear.I'm still hoping that sony will do the same. I really can't wait on getting my hands on all those great PS4 games that I missed out on. (Yes. I will definitely make use of the PS plus collection)

**What will the UI look like?**Up until now we were only able to get a short glimpse at the new Playstation 5 UI. I'm really looking forward on getting more footage of the UI.

**What's with Background Applications like Discord, or Teamspeak?**It wasn't possible with the Playstation 4 but maybe with the 5. I really would like to be able to talk to my PC or Xbox friends while I'm playing on my PS5 without leaving my computer on. This feature would really improve the whole gaming experience.

**Will we ever get a black PS5 oder atleast good Playstation 5 skins?**The opinions on the Playstation 5 design vary quite a lot and range from ""I love it"" to ""It's fcking disgusting"". The design of consoles or rather more everything is always a highly subjective matter but still... Sony made a high risk choice. The Playstation 5 design really stands out and some or not many people would appreciate the ability to get  rid  of the white colour. I am really hoping for a black PS5.Thankfully Dbrand already announced their skin line-up for the Playstation 5.

Will disk-based PS5 games require a full-copy/install to play?,coreysnyder04,"Update: This is 100% the case. I didn't realize PS4 already does this so fully expect this to continue. 

Has Sony talked about how they plan to handle disk-based games and game installs? This new PS5 SSD technology doesn't really apply if the system has to try to read the data from the disk, which I'd guess is many factors slower than SSD read speeds. I imagine it wouldn't need to copy over certain things, like menus and other data that doesn't need to be read as quickly. But those make up a small portion of the actual game data.

What I could totally see them doing is: You pop the disk in, and it has to copy over nearly the entire game over to the SSD for gameplay. I REALLY hope this isn't the case. The reason I bought the disk-based console is to mitigate the issue that my HD is constantly full from downloading games/updates. If the console requires copying over disk-based games, that benefit goes out the window. I would still get the benefit that copying from disk is still faster than download speeds if I want to delete and later reinstall the game.

Thoughts?

I know that specs don't matter but PS5 is way closer than people think to the Series X on every level,Krios625,"1. The CPU conundrum and why many seem to misunderstand it. While *fixed clocked speeds seem inherently better than variable frequencies, they are much harder to cool since the system needs to be ready for a worse case scenario at all times and use up more power needlessly.* There's a reason why every major semiconductor has ditched fixed clock speeds for more than 5 years and it's the reason the PS4 seemed loud as heck (lack of culling) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/fujtke/purpose_of_variable_frequencies/) thread sums the this point better if interested but that's the basic idea why PS5 went for Smartshift vs going for a fixed frequency.
2. GPU: Same point about the variable clock speeds vs fixed. The biggest difference to me here is the amount of CU's the Series X has for RT performance vs  the PS5 not the Tflops.  80 bil ray/s x 208 RT cores (52 x 4 TMU's per CU's in RDNA2 and each TMU has 1 RT Core in RDNA2) x 1825 mhz divided by the industry standard 10 deep BVH and the result is roughly 38 Giga rays/s , so it will have way better performance on that front. Now the PS5 GPU has more fill rate, internal GPU bandwidth and faster triangle set-up so it's not a knockout just because Youtubers tell u 12 vs 10,2 Tflops.
3. Ram: The biggest problem for the Series X imo. While it's 10 GB's of Vram are **insanely fast** (can't stress that enough) it's simply not enough for some games at 4K, we're seeing that now with the 3080 and just how much lack of Vram can hurt. Problem number 2 is that it's segmented unlike the PS5's unified 16 GB running at 448 GB/s. The Series X also uses half a gig of ram more than the PS5 for the OS but that's nothing crazy.
4. SSD: Short and sweet since this isn't much of a battle. The Series X in theory can do a maximum of 6GB/s compressed which thanks to bottle necks is closer to 3GB/S real life performance. PS5 can go to up to 22 GB/S thanks to the IO coprocessors, crazy SSD and Kraken Decompression unit meaning in real performance that games can load in about 2 -3 seconds flat.

Conclusion: The PS5 was designed to be as easy to develop for as humanely possible (which was clear after the Road to PS5) since it doesn't have any major bottlenecks as a system and while not offering the same beefy performance as the Series X it does make it's power easier to access to devs so I don't think anyone should expect major if any differences on 3rd party multiplats.

Idea for a new Castlevania game,ktsmith91,"This is my own personal opinion on how to make a new one and how to do it right. To be clear, this is a 3D Castlevania game.

- Dark Souls/Bloodborne inspired with a focus on the checkpoint to checkpoint style gameplay
- Game is meant to be difficult but fair *(just like Dark Souls and the Classic Castlevania games)*
- Classic enemies from the old games to come back with their iconic designs but just modernized a bit
- Soundtrack meant to invoke memories of playing the NES and SNES Castlevania games
- Whip is used to attack as well as grab items or even get to areas out of reach of a normal jump
- Bring back the wall meat behind secret breakable walls!
- Classic items like the cross, the throwing axe and holy water to return and with some new functionality to make them useful in a 3D environment 
- Base game features a full and complete story of the main character, Simon Belmont, defeating Dracula
- Each DLC is it’s own story with new locations, enemies, and you play as a new character with unique weapons and items",0,0.41,24,2020-09-25 13:15:26

Sony can and should offer PS5 enhanced versions of PS4 games for free like microsoft.,2FAST2FURIOUS993,"Microsoft lets you buy a copy of grand theft auto 4 13 years ago and still support it on their next generation hardware. Sony can't even make a enhanced version of spiderman ps4 free to current owners.

Edit: ok so GTA IV was a bad example (but a fantastic game, pls be on ps5), basically my point was that CDPR, ubisoft, microsoft and a few others have said that the next generation version, as in the entire updated/enhanced game will be available to current owners for free.
These games are going to be a goodwill to consumers who are early adopters to new platforms and will hopefully be available years into the generation.

Sony is ""remastering"" a 2 year old game rather than providing a substantial update, this is a ploy to get people to buy it twice, they are clearly not trying to bolster sales to people who do not own it because it's only available as a collectors edition on top of the sequel.

Expanding Your PS5 Drive Space? Note That NVMe Drives Must Be Whitelisted by Sony,vgskid,"I’m seeing a lot of chatter after Microsoft released their SSD expansion drive ($220!!!!). That’s honestly a lot of money. However, I’m seeing a lot of response from people saying that thank goodness PS5 will take any NVMe drive which can have prices anywhere from $50 to hundreds of dollars depending on size. 

However, you need to note that Sony must [whitelist the SSD drive](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5)

You can’t use any NVMe drive, so please don’t buy a cheap one you found online thinking it’ll work. I don’t believe anything has been officially whitelisted by Sony yet. There’s one drive that people are assuming might work, which is [this one](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price).

Note that it’s $229 for 1TB. The cost of super fast load times and world loading is expensive. At least for now. *So I just wanted to warn people and inform people to just wait for a bit until we get official confirmation from Sony on which drives will work. And brace yourself on price. Maybe they’ll be $229, maybe they’ll be less, but they definitely won’t be cheap. Don’t buy a NVMe drive until we get confirmation that it’ll work in the system.*

Edit: There’s some discussion of semantics on what “whitelisting” means in this article. It’s beside the point. Sony and Mark Cerny have already stated they will provide a list of compatible drives. If the system may allow drives that Sony doesn’t recommend but still technically work, that’s up to individuals to try. For the vast majority of you, focus on the italicized text above and do not buy anything until Sony provides a list of compatible drives. The system doesn’t take just any NVMe drive and buying some random cheap one off Amazon will not work.",712,0.95,479,2020-09-25 05:21:06

I think it's understandable that a lot of people have made ""see you in 2025"" jokes after what happened with FFXV and FFVII Remake. However, it's important to remember that the team behind FFXVI is a completely different team from those games. They share none of the same leaders, and the team behind FFXVI is known for its efficiency (primarily due to their work on the MMO, FFXIV).

How to improve PS Now?,schneper,"While PS Now has more than enough titles to be played, the majority of games have to be streamed. Only certain PS4 and surprisingly PS2 titles can be downloaded. There is no way to emulate PS3 games. Streaming games requires a very strong internet connection, preferably a wired connection or 5ghz wireless. However, the quality of streamed games via PS Now isn't up to the quality compared to other cloud based services (e.g. GeForce Now). How could Sony make the service much more appealing to costumers? Here are some points that i think would greatly enhance the service:

1. **Make PS Now a software based full backwards compatibility solution:**

\- Bring back the game catalog of PS1 classics and expand the games we have on PS Now

\- Make it possible to emulate PS3 games  (maybe the PS5 could do it?) OR improve the streaming quality;

\- PSNow should be the ""game pass"" of older Playstation games

**2. Tie in the Playstation Store**

\- The PS4 can emulate PS2 games; why didnt we get the PS2 games we bought digitally back in the store? -&gt; apply this to PS1 games aswell

\- Games available on PSNow should be able to be bought through the PS Store (apply this for PS4 and PS5 users)

**3. PS Plus**

\- PSNow should be included in PS Plus OR in a PS Plus Premium subscription

\- Give away one month of PSNow (or PS Plus) whenever someone buys accessoires for their consoles (like controllers)

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to see PS Now as a software solution to the missing full backwards compatibility we have on the PS5. Bring back PS1 and PS2 games into the PS Store, because there really is no reason to keep those games away from the store, when we can already see that the PS4 console can emulate PS2 games through PSNow. Also, if it can emulate PS2 games, it should also be able to emulate PS1 games easily. I admit PS3 games are tricky, and if the PS5 is not able to emulate PS3 games, then Sony should improve their cloud based gaming.

**TL;DR:** Bring back PS1/PS2 games to the store, add those games into PSNow, improve cloud based gaming for PS3 games, include the service in PS Plus or in a new ""Premium"" PS Plus subscription",48,0.74,79,2020-09-25 02:52:47

Appreciation of future proofing,hmma31595,"With 49 days left to go I wanted to draw some attention to some of the benefits of an upgrade that aren’t necessarily game related. The quality of life stuff that as a launch PS4 owner are the biggest reasons I’m super amped for the next generation. Those being the NVME expandable storage, WiFi 6, and HDMI 2.1. All of those are yet to be ubiquitous, and while we may have a slightly weaker console it’s amazing that they packed years worth of upgrades in for the same cost as a competitor. 

WiFi 6 is still potentially limited for some things on PlayStation’s end, but with game streaming and digital downloads becoming more and more prevalent and gigabit internet becoming more common it’s awesome that we may see much higher throughput. 

NVME upgradeable internal storage is a HUGE win. Not being locked to a certain size or company could benefit us immensely in terms of cost in the long run. 

HDMI 2.1 is already here, though not super affordable yet. While I don’t see these consoles ever hitting 8K with some insane DLSS style magic 4K 120 already feels like a great late gen target for especially first party titles. 

Let me know if I’m out of line or missed something!

TLDR; I’m really excited for the quality of life stuff on PS5, a couple that aren’t even available with competitors. Next gen is all about convenience and I’m here for it.",30,0.65,113,2020-09-25 00:56:50

For all those worried that £70 will become the standard game price,ChrisRR,"Game prices are typically inflated at launch due to a captive market.  This link, thanks to u/xenorvernix shows that most launch titles were priced at £55.

After launch prices for new titles dropped to around £40 (rising to £45-50 in 2018 due to the falling value of the pound)

I really don't like the location of Spider-Man: Miles Morales. so listen to me rant about it,Swarica,"Not going to lie, kind of got mad when I heard in the trailer, ""This is the best part of living in Harlem."" Yea I know Harlem is cool and I know that's where he lives in the Spider-Man for PS4 game, but the map is going to be an exact copy of the PS4 map. Unless you can go farther north of Manhattan I don't really want to just play a copy of Spider-Man for PS4 if the only difference is the story and characters.

In my humble opinion I think it should've taken place is Brooklyn, and here's why

1. Miles lives in Brooklyn. In the original comics, most tv show's he's been referenced in. Heck, even Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
2. Brooklyn is a completely different map. New places to explore and people can get over playing in Manhattan and move onto Brooklyn. I think it's idiotic that they just copy and pasted the exact same thing. At least move the location
3. Brooklyn is so much better than Manhattan. First, it's skyline is still pretty large and if that's the only reason it's still in Manhattan is because it's skyline is slightly smaller that's like saying L.A. is better because the hills are bigger than San Diego. Second, People who aren't familiar with Brooklyn can get to know at least the basics. I had no idea where things were in Manhattan but Spider-Man for PS4 taught me that. I think we're all ready to move on to Manhattan's younger but cooler sister. And Third, Manhattan is boring to at least me... I can't tell you how many times I've played PS4 Spider-Man but then just got bored of Manhattan. I wished I could go to Brooklyn or even at least to liberty island but no. Just same old Manhattan
4. And finally, Why not? It's not like there's gonna be any problems. One, If it's because Brooklyn is too big, then just cut a few things out. Not all of Brooklyn has to be there. And if it's because Brooklyn has some parts that are mostly residential and filled with one story/two story houses... well
5. Why they shouldn't... There are a ton of parts in Brooklyn where it's just mostly residential houses and not apartments or tall skyscrapers. But of course there are in Manhattan too. Not as much of course but still. I think that is one of the main reasons why they won't stage it in Brooklyn, but I still think Brooklyn would be a lovely place for a Spider-Man to take place in. So get on that

EDIT:

So I've gotten the feedback I wanted and turns out the game wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. People have told me it's more of an expansion pack than a new game in of itself. And it seems some people do agree with me. But in the wrong context

People agree that when actual Spider-Man 2 comes out, then yes it would be amazing to be able to go to Brooklyn and or... Jersey City? Anyway people really didn't agree with me ranting about this game. The game I was ranting about was a game that was just more of an expansion pack than a new game. And yea I didn't know that and yea I probably should've researched it before making a 5-6 paragraph post ranting about it.

In conclusion. I still think that going to Brooklyn in actual Spider-Man 2 would be awesome. But for now I understand why they wouldn't for this game. ",0,0.22,29,2020-09-24 15:42:17

Are These M Rated Games Appropriate For A 13 Year Old?,Cool_Kid13,"A bit of back round knowledge I am a 13 year old who is a soon to be first time play PlayStation owner.

Like many of you I am really excited for the PlayStation 5. I was one of the lucky few who was able to preorder the PlayStation 5. I plan to use the PlayStation 5 for backwards compatibility for the first one to two years. I already have the Uncharted games, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ratchet and Clank. My problem is that there are four M rated games I want to play, these are God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. I cant play these games legally unless my parents buy the games for me. So what makes these games M rated? My parents would be ok with stuff like bad words and a bit of blood but things like really gory stuff or other stuff I don't know about. So If you can leave a reply about stuff that happens in these games that would be nice and if you need to know more i'll try to answer people.

TL;DR Im 13 and want these M rated games God of War, Last of us, Persona 5, and Ghost of Tsushima. What makes them M rated?

UPDATE

I looked at what many people have said. I think I am going to get Persona 5 and God of War. People said the other to games were a bit much, I will wait to get those games till I am older. People said god of war is a lot of fantasy violence and bad words which is ok. I still kinda think about if my parents will let me play Persona 5 but, Many of you said I had Important themes that could show me good morales. I'll probably ask for these games in Christmas season and thats when my parents will look into this stuff. So thanks for helping me with the good advice!",184,0.8,376,2020-09-24 08:58:09

"SOCOM Is Sony’s Opportunity to compete against Call of Duty, and they seriously need it",OxEagle19,"This is probably going to get seriously downvoted, but I think it needs to be said. While Sony has gotten a great reputation for their single-player exclusives, none of their IP can match the behemoth amount of popularity and clout as the Call off Duty series and Fortnite. 

Why does that matter?

Sony has been aggressively making third-Party deals to make PS5 the best place to play those games, whether it be their deals with Activision, Rockstar, timed exclusivity with Bethesda, or exclusive DLC from the Marvel Avengers Game. And while that may help Sony in the short-term, they need their own IP that is as large as a publishers like Square Enix, Rockstar, or Activision. The reason why is because they simply cannot afford to just straight up buy studios like that, at least not as large as those I just mentioned. Sure Sony is building their own reputation with these IP’s, God of War, The Last of Us, and many more, but these IP’s don’t make the same amount of money as COD, Battlefield, FIFA, Fortnite or any battle royale game. They absolutely need at least one IP as big as them because if Microsoft can just throw money at a studio like ZeniMax and own them, it doesn’t matter if those games are put on PS5, if Microsoft felt like it, they could just not put those games on there. We could speculate whether they would or wouldn’t, but that doesn’t matter, the very fact that they COULD isn’t something to take lightly and should be combated.

I think SOCOM has the potential to be as big an IP as Call of Duty, and it needs to be so that way they have at least one game that has a similar wide amount of appeal and monetization that they have more power to sway others to the ecosystem, and more importantly have the cash to rival Microsoft. This is just my opinion, but I do think it’s important that Sony as a whole has the buying power to sway others from getting bought out completely by negotiating third-Party deals, and Sony needs that cash cow where their profits are exceedingly high compared to the cost to produce them. And plus, SOCOM kicked ass, it deserves a comeback, and knowing Sony, it could be a cash cow without being soulless either. And please, I’m not a fanboy, I just don’t want Microsoft to become have a monopoly on gaming.",0,0.41,59,2020-09-24 03:47:17

Is anyone else shocked by the entitlement?,zslayer89,"This is mostly referring to Spider-Man Remaster, but could apply to future games.

I've been seeing people in lots of threads essentially crapping all over Insomniac and Sony for charging for the remaster of SM. People are stating that the remaster should be free and cite that other games are getting free upgrade paths to PS5.

Now I'm not opposed to games getting free upgrade paths to the PS5. But what is coming with those upgrades? If it's minor work that equates to the flip of the switch that provides better fps, slightly better graphics and even better load times, then yes that should be free. People like to bring up Witcher 3 and the free upgrades its getting, but from what's stated in articles that people cite, it sounds like the witcher is mostly(I know they said something about ray tracing) just getting upscaled graphics,fps bump and load bump.

But a game like SM:remaster isn't just doing that. [Here](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/16/see-the-marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-new-gameplay-demo/) you will see that the remaster isn't a simple upscale job. Insomniac went back to a 2 year old game and completely updated many assets. There will be better hair, facial animations, skin, eyes, the new model for Peter. Also you'll they added ray-traced reflections and ambient shadows, improved lighting, more pedestrians and vehicles stretching further into the distance, and the same optional performance mode offered on Miles Morales. This will  allow you to play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate. The remaster will be supporting near-instant loading, 3D audio, and the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback. They are also  adding three new Spider-Man suits, new photo mode features, and new trophies.


Then people start talking about Cyberpunk giving a free ps5 upgrade down the line as some kind of major counter point. It's not. Cyber Punk has been in development for quite some time, and it's very likely that they knew that the next gen console wasn't far off. This means that time was built in to have these upgrades ready at some point after launch. It's not like SM (2018) that has been completed for two years and is now being reworked for the PS5. I've also heard that because of the fact that it's releasing on PC, the development is concurrent and that makes it easier to develop for the next gen consoles. 


I don't know, it's just shocking to me. It's like if someone is doing someone's backyard and make it look super nice (a new deck, new lawn, some trees, a water feature) they get paid when they complete the job. Now the job is complete and time has passed and you want to update your backyard a bit, update some features to make them look nicer, and in some cases replace certain parts all together, well that takes time and will be paid for as well. It likely won't cost the same as doing the original project, but still changes were made and new things are being added in. 

What do you all think? What should be the criteria for free upgrades and what should be the criteria for a paid upgrade? To me, if you are going back and putting in a lot of new things into an old game, that should be paid. If it's just what amount to performance bumps, graphics quality increases etc, that should be free.

I wish we knew the expected lifespan of the DualSense.,Moto507,"Most of my controller failures have been from triggers going bad. And the DualSense is ditching the typical trigger springs used in the Dualshock 4. These new triggers sound incredible too. Between the ability to increase pressure as the trigger is pulled and lock it at certain points, I can't wait to try it out. So we'll have this new tech in our hands and no statements as to whether or not it'll last longer. Especially since games these days are much more reliant on the triggers. I remember when shooters used face buttons to fire, and acceleration in racers was X. Now they're fully on the triggers for ADS/FIRE and BRAKE/GAS. Also joining them is action games with the influence of Dark Souls bringing light and heavy attacks to the bumper and trigger respectively. What at one point were just buttons on the front of the controller, are now arguably the most heavily used functions across nearly every genre. I just wish they'd say something along the lines of ""it's more durable.""",0,0.3,34,2020-09-23 19:52:31

"Sony should buy Konami's franchises like Castlevania, MGS, Contra, Silent Hill, Pro Evolution Soccer",Konval,"Boy oh boy what I wouldn't do for a Soulsborne-esque Castlevania. Its a huge franchise that Konami has been mishandling for a long time. The Netflix show is a hit and the sweet memory of Symphony of the Night is on every original Playstation fan's mind.

With PES, Sony could have a decent alternative/competitor to Fifa, which honestly has been going down in quality for basically a decade. I know EA has monopoly on licenses, but Sony could do something creative to work around it.

Contra could be remade in 3D and be similar to Doom or even Killzone, or it could stay 2D and be reborn as a rogue-like series.

MGS and Silent Hill... nothing needs to be said. Konami virtually seppuku'd with these two franchises.

Issue with existing Sam's Club order - I advise everyone that lives in an apartment building to check their order,obtusekomodo," The address on my profile includes my apartment number - the ""Ship to:"" address on my order DOES NOT include my apartment number.

I called to question this and they confirmed my apartment number is not included, so it will be delivered to the lobby of my building - they also told me **it is impossible to update the address** it is being shipped to. Their recommendation was to cancel my order and order it again (not happening).

The solution is to wait until November 10th (when it will ship) and call them - they will conference me with FedEx and add the apartment number whilst it is in transit. I'll be camping in my lobby on the 12th.

Again - the issue is on Sam's Club end - my address is correct on my profile just NOT the shipping area so I advise everyone to double-check that managed to preorder.",206,0.93,47,2020-09-22 23:59:00
"Insomniac is finally first party, it's time to return to the Resistance",jolly_chugger,"Resistance 2 is one of the best realised, and most genuinely enjoyable games I've ever played. 

Single player. The story, the foreboding, the descent into madness. You play as an absolute superhuman, hot on the trail of the leaders and the dark secrets swirling behind the scenes. The final scene of resistance 2 will forever be etched in my mind,

""Can you hear them calling to us? It's beautiful"" + fade to black + gunshot

FULL CO-OP! But this ain't yo mommas co-op. In Resistance you play as a member on one of the teams charged with cleaning up and preparing the way for the main character in the single player game. Skills, progression, immersion, again one of the best co-op experiences that has only been exceeded by monster Hunter in my mind

Multiplayer. No longer are you a god, nor a super soldier, you're now a grunt. The lowest of the low you fight in the constant meat grinder of the frontlines in the ongoing alien invasion. Praying to last long enough for some faceless hero to stem the incessant tides so you can see tomorrow. In this mode you actually step in to the shoes of the chimera, which was mind blowing

Then there were the brilliant guns. The auger, hedgehog, marksman rifle, etc. All the guns felt great, and packed with personality

Unfortunately Resistance 3 threw out basically every thing great about 2 and signaled its untimely demise. Although it is interesting how much it foreshadowed naughty dog's eventual masterpiece, TLOU

With guerrilla going hard on horizon, Sony is short of a flagship shooter.

What are your hopes and dreams for next gen?,IFuckinLikeCheese,"What do you want to happen next gen, no matter how likely it may be? 

Here's my dreams for next gen:

-either microsoft makes ES6, doom, and starfield available on ps5, or they make game pass available on ps5. I need a good pc for music production but id rather do all my gaming on the ps5 with duelsense.

-Sony buys FROM software, and gives that sweet funding and support to future souls like titles. 

-Resistance fall of man remake

-60fps Bloodborne

-Square Enix, Kojima productions, capcom, and rockstar stay 3rd party devs.

- I hope demon souls does really well and then bluepoint try to make their own soulslike IP. That gameplay looks soo clean.

- A Sony Studio making a full out RPG akin to Skyrim in open endedness.

- Naughty Dog making a new Linear Story IP with a whole new vibe. Maybe a sci fi, or a detective story, or a war story. 

- Pleeeease let Hogwarts Legacy be good. The franchise desperately needs a good entry. 

- I want the Dune movie to do really well and then get either a linear story or open world game on Arrakis. Im a huge nerd for the books. Crysknife and lasgun combat and survival mechanics when in the desert. Video game worms. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm

- An ancient egypt open world game not part of assassins creed.

- Probably wont happen but I want Portal 1 and 2 remastered and released as 1 game on ps5.

- Remake RDR1 in the RDR2 map (adding in mexico). Make it playable after beating the RDR2 story. It would just make so much sense. Would warrant a replay so hard.

- kojima made silent hill reboot. 

- a good remake of Resident Evil 4

- for atomic heart to be as good as it looks

- for the duelsense battery to last a very long time on a full charge.

- rockband 4 complete edition where it comes with every song (dlc and base game) from all 4 games, plus ps5 compatible instruments. Not a lot of hope for this one lol

- an open world game where you play as a cop, and part of the main story involves discovering corruption within your own police force regarding a crime conspiracy, and then going rogue to stop it.

I don’t think the Sony preorder invites were as random as we thought,ohmyitsmeluigi,"I don’t think the Sony invites were as random as we thought, and here’s why

First off, I am not an expert on marketing in any way shape or form, but I do think I see why some people got the Sony invite and others didn’t. 

Let’s first look at how you signed up for a chance to get an invite. We were all able to send in our PSN name to be placed on an email list of the possibility to get a pre-order invite. Sony, being a big tech company, has more than enough resources to create a computer system to filter through all those who put their PSN name in their data base. They can look at how often you play, how often you buy digital games, how long you’ve owned a PlayStation product, etc. 

Now let’s look at those who did and didn’t get an invite. This is all based on the megathread comments and not any real information. From reading the comments, there was many complaints about how people didn’t get their invite for a preorder, even though they spend hours and hours playing games, spending tons of money on buying digital games, having every single PlayStation console, and having x amount platinum trophies. You’re what you call a hardcore PlayStation player. And another complaint I would hear from the hardcore PlayStation players was that a lot of their friends who got the invite hardly play as often as they do. Or they barely got their PS4 a few months ago. How did they get an invite and I didn’t? Here what I think is why

I believe those who aren’t hardcore PlayStation players are casual players. And Sony wanted to cater towards those casual players to get them to buy their product. More than likely, those of you who are considered casual gamers would buy a system eventually, either when it comes out, or later on during its life cycle. Or even if you do plan on buying a console, it’s possible you were already on the fence about which console to buy. I mean, let’s face it, Xbox has one heck of a deal with their monthly plan being available. They wanted to sway the casual gamer towards the PlayStation by sending them a very special invite that basically guarantees them a preorder. But why not the hardcore PlayStation fan? Because they figure hardcore gamers are more than likely going to buy a PS5 regardless if they get an invite or not. Now those of you who didn’t get an invite, ask yourself, are you still looking for a PS5 everyday? And if you can’t find one today, will you look tomorrow? And if you answered yes to these questions, Sony has you where they want you. 

Let’s look at how they marketed the PS5 as well. First off they created two different, but the same systems. A digital and a disk version. These were not revealed for the longest time and neither were their prices and release dates. When it comes to their prices and release date for preorders, they wanted to create a mock supply and demand by placing the preorders out of the blue soon after their event. I think this was by design more than we think. Yes, I do also think it was to keep away scalpers. Which was smart. But it also created a panic of, “Oh no! I have to get one now! Where can I find it?! They’re all sold out of preorders!” And that’s when they started to send out the invites. After the initial frenzy that occurred. It’s like they were playing mental games amongst its users by saying all no it’s all gone, but you are a special one and you’ll get an invite. 

This all might just be bogus, but this is why I think the Sony invites were not as random as we thought. What do you all think?

EDIT: This is all speculation. There is no conclusive evidence to this at all. It was just a thought that I had. Accessibility is huge with marketing. If you can’t access it, then you can’t buy it. If you’re a casual player and don’t have access to an immediate preorder, you’re less likely going to seek a preorder out. And to change up a little to what I had to say, “Casual players were more likely to get an invite than hardcore players”",0,0.33,21,2020-09-22 23:20:40

Digital versions of the PS5 may only make up 15-20% of the available stock. This means you probably have a better chance if you try to get a Standard edition whenever pre-orders go up.,moby323,"[SOURCE ](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-09-21-playstation-5-digital-edition-stock-far-lower-than-standard-ps5-sources-say)

This is on top of the fact that the $100 lower cost means that the demand for the digital edition seems to be pretty high. 

I’m guessing that Sony knows that, initially, people will probably be willing to pay more to be one of the first people to get them. 

Also, if they think they can rapidly sell pretty much all the units they can manufacture, it is only logical to have the factory churning out the more expensive version at first. 


With that in mind, if you are racing to snag one when pre orders go up, you are probably more likely to get one if you go for the standard edition.",713,0.94,456,2020-09-22 21:45:50

If there is one thing Sony can learn from bethesda acquisition is that timed exclusives are not the way forward,teenaxta,"Lately Sony has been pushing timed exclusives really hard.  **Bugsnax, Deathloop, GhostWire: Tokyo, Godfall, Kena Bridge of spirits,  Oddworld: Soulstorm** these are all timed exclusives. 

In some cases timed exclusives are good. Where you give a small developer the budget to develop their games and in return you get it as a timed exclusive like in the case of Nier Automata. but in most other cases, its a No no.

Not only will these games come to other consoles, it feels wasted potential. Rather than getting timed exclusivity deal on so many games, Sony should acquire or develop a new studio. At least by doing so you get to own the IP, the talent and the pedigree.  A single proper high budget exclusive like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon Zero Dawn does more for the console prestige than 4-5 timed exclusives. These games become ambassadors of the console, while the timed exclusive part is forgotten. Now I am not saying that Sony should go and buy a big publisher, but they should be on the look out for studios with potential, like they did with insomniac.",0,0.46,125,2020-09-22 21:13:42
Why do we still know so little about the PS5!?,theothrsn27,"idk if this has already been posted anywhere, but what is going on with Sony this year!?

I'm not against sequels if they fit but a sequel just for sequels sake not a fan of that.(I have been pleasantly surprised by some)

In my mind, a remaster will likely include all new textures, possibly run in the engine from MM rather than the older version used in 2018. 

Not to mention possibly adding content or using more features of the PS5 than just “it loads faster”. 

I understand a lot of company’s are doing patches to make their older games run better but my bet is that they are not full remasters for the new system taking advantage of haptic feedback, Improved AI possibilities etc. Most likely these “upgraded” games will run at a higher frame rate, add in RT or just load much faster.

In all, I think paying $20 for a remastered version of 2018 Spiderman will probably be worth it as long as it takes some of the new features of the PS5 and implements then.",17,0.67,45,2020-09-22 19:41:21

Imagine what PlayStation could do with proper backing.,King_A_Acumen,"Like we all know that the only reason Xbox has stuck around for so long is that MS could keep throwing money at it, the reason Gamepass is there is because MS can just keep on eating the losses.

Sometimes I wonder what PS could do if they had similar backing to what Xbox has. I feel like if PS did have proper backing there would be a PS version of Gamepass and what not. Xbox also has the benefit of having huge teams of people to draw from other MS services.

I hope that PS does somehow create a gamepass thing because it would be great, I understand the high prices of games but I would like a Netflix but for gaming or atleast something like Disney+ for Sony first-party games.

PS4 and PS5 being used concurrently in the same house. What options do I have?,Effayy,"So I'm a father of 4. Over the past few years, my PS4 has basically become my kids' console.

Question is:. If I'm playing TLOU2, or RDR2, or Spiderman:MM with my account on the PS5, will my kids still be able to log in with the child accounts on the PS4 and have access to my game library there as well?

Sony really do need to respond to the Zenimax acquisition, I know that it doesn't ""threaten"" them as such, they still have more must have games than anyone else and will always sell hardware because of that, but it does basically single handedly put Microsoft back in the race and threatens further acquisition down the road.

Everyone suggests names like Capcom, Konami, Square Enix and FROM. Are any of these feasible? Personally I think Take 2 is simple too expensive.

Of all of those I feel Capcom would be main source of quality, must have games. Konami would provide a lot of valuable IP and, crucially, a football (soccer) game - if PES could be significantly invested in then it could potentially rival FIFA at a time when fans basically despise that series.",0,0.36,103,2020-09-22 06:20:45

It was a given the console was going to have a disk drive as it's also considered an entertainment centre for most so removing the disk drive would have been a terrible move.
But with the new console focusing more on load times this gen, I was sort of expecting a new kind of physical copy for games.
I know disks nowadays can hold a massive amount of information compared to say 10 years ago but has the read/write speed increased with this also?

I took this as them telling us that the retailers would give us plenty of advance notice on what day and what time they would let us buy a PS5.

Oh I'm not the biggest fan of ubisoft. The only game series I still play  from them is assassins creed. And I know it will be mostly copy paste.  Like all their open world games. But yeah for some reason I still enjoy those mostly. Maybe someday we will get a new PoP.

Immortals Fenyx Rising actually looks like a better Zelda breath of the wild  clone. So I'm very interested in that after seeing 40min gameplay. So  here is crossing my fingers that this new IP turns out as great as the  demo looked.

Before someone mentions Cyberpunk; I'm probably going to wait until those PS5 specific upgrades are done. That  will probably take a few months.

Games from the PS3 that need a PS5 port or remaster:,coreyc444,"Sometimes a game doesn't always get its fair share because of programming of a console or it's just not the right time for that specific game. I definitely think there are some ps3 games that didn't get what they deserve and should be remastered for the PS5

1. Mod Nation Racers
This game is awesome. The best cart racer I've played in years. The major problem with this game was the horrendous loading screens. If we can get this game over to a system with an awesome ssd it can those once again. This game was better than Mario kart in my opinion. The customization was stellar. Sony needs to bring this one back in a remaster. Not much else needs to be changed. The game still holds up today.
2. Socom
Socom was Sony's first foray into online multiplayer and it killed the franchise after the PSN outage of 2011. This is no reason to kill that franchise. Getting this game back in a free to play type game could certainly boon Sony's first party presence. 
3. Resistance 1-3
These games are excellent scifi shooters with a great story. The weapon variety is imaginative in a very bleak world. Insomniac continues to tease these games. Getting us a remaster of these games would be awesome. 
4. Starhawk
Starhawk is an excellent. Real time combat and strategy military game. Building a base and creating ways to overcome your opponents in the game is a blast. With how online multiplayer has increased since this game it would be awesome to bring this back with customization options and adding even more game mode would be great. There aren't many games like it out there and the multiplayer of it was addicting.",13,0.64,93,2020-09-21 14:06:11

While we wait for launch: day what’s your favorite PlayStation memory and why?,betabetafishfish,"Hi friends,

We don’t have too much time left before the state of this sub evolves into a proper console forum. Before we get there, I’ve been enjoying the casual posts on here so I want to chat about our favorite PlayStation memories.

I have a ton. I’m a Nintendo fanboy at heart, but Sony has always held a special place with me since the PS1. I think my favorite memories are tied to playing The Last of Us. Sure, the game is awe-inspiring, but it’s more about where I was at in life. I was a freshman in college, pretty aimless, and all the other tropes of being an early twenty-something year old. But playing through that game with the people in my life at the time was a very special thing. Not to get cheesy on everyone, but it’s like the quote  “I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”

When the PS4 launched, I played the Remastered version of the game. I would often leave the console idle and my theme at the time was this [one](https://youtu.be/Xr6OnQZUFW4). Hearing it idle now immediately takes me back to where I was living and the headspace I was in. And that was years and years ago.

Okay, I’m done getting nostalgic. What are YOUR favorite PlayStation memories?

Any interest in a Jurassic Park game for next-gen?,WigglingWeiner,"Just finished watching Camp Cretaceous. Awesome show, definitely not for kids. Anyway...

It got me thinking, how come there is not a proper survival Jurassic Park game? The entire park, and you have to scavenge, look for food, water, weapons.

You have to cover your scent with Dino shit or piss, look for a map/gps to watch out for the territory which Dino is mostly roaming/found roaming in.

Get hunted by velociraptors, collectibles like finding books about how to possibly hunt/find info about specific dinosaurs, ala exhibits found in various parts of the park. 

Maintenance tunnels too, with the Park Adventure kayak/monorail.

Climb high canopies/climb trees, etc!

Roam through high grass and stumble upon corpses of dinosaurs, only to realize you stumbled upon a T-Rex nest

We've had a viable PS3 emulator on PC now for at least a couple of years, and it runs almost every PS3 game out there. If a small group of unpaid community members, investing free time and living off donations can do it, I'm sure it would be a joke for Sony to actually make one.

Personally, I'd even buy it as a one-time paid app if it meant I could play my PS3 discs and digital titles on my PS5. I'm glad they put in PS4 support, but I'm really hoping that maybe even in a year's time we see Sony contribute something towards PS3 backwards compatibility. It's a feature I want the most.

For those that don't know, this is how they're able to get any game that isn't of the current generation, running on the current-gen console. It's how the phatty PS3s ran PS2 games.",0,0.19,29,2020-09-21 04:20:30

"Considering the PS5 has similar internal structures to the PS4 Pro, (presumably) for supporting backwards compatibility, how is that not holding the PS5 back?",iwojima22,"All this talk about the Series S, backwards compatibility and PS5 going cross gen but not much about how Sony accomplished PS4 backwards compatibility. Especially why it’s only PS4. 

Not even Sony is clear on if these games will be upgraded, only that they’re getting them to properly run or “take advantage of the Pro’s enhancements.” But the PS5 has the same amount of Compute Units as the PS4 Pro. Most likely a design choice for easy backwards compatibility, as opposed to Microsoft actually putting in effort to design their hardware to support all generations AND free visual upgrades across the board. 

What if the PS5 had 52 compute units, like the Series X, as opposed to 36, just like the PS4 Pro? Wouldn’t they be able to make even beefier games? 

Here’s Jim Ryan in 2017 responding to Sony’s backwards compatibility efforts[ “When we’ve dabbled with backwards compatibility, I can say it is one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much,” says Ryan. “That, and I was at a Gran Turismo event recently where they had PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games, and the PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?”](https://time.com/4804768/playstation-4-ps4-pro-psvr-sales/) I highly doubt they’ve changed their tune in 2020 so I wouldn’t expect any older games getting visual upgrades because “why would anybody play this.” I guess.

An example of this could be seen in Gran Turismo, imagine you are racing in the cockpit view and want to see how close a car is to your side,  so instead of using the minimap or using the right stick to view left or right, you just turn your head a little and the camera looks in that direction

also does it have a mic on it? I already have some really good headphones and these things seem expensive (i think i saw 130$) but if its gotta mic and does what i mentioned above im all in. I wish i knew sooner i couldve had it locked in but ill get my chance again",0,0.3,9,2020-09-21 04:38:54

Obvious features that should be in PS5,MuhtarCx,"1. **Real multitasking.**

*Accessible true web and mobile apps, for voice and chat. Or just add Discord*

*Friends should be able to hop in and watch your gameplay instantaneously, without fiddling around with shareplay settings during game. There should be a general option to allow or deny.*

Regional Pricing. A Brief Look.,imcrazyandproud,"The conversation about the increase in games prices has been dominated by the $10 increase in the USA but its important to see how these prices have changed worldwide especially with the digital only PS5. 

UK £55 -&gt; £70   an increase by  $19.37 to  $90.42  

EU  € 70 -&gt;  € 80 an increase by  $11.84  to $94.73

Aus $100 -&gt; $125 an increase by $18.23 to $91.15

Jpn   ¥7,590 - &gt; ¥7,900 an increase by $2.96 to $75.55  

California\* (after sales tax) $ 64.95 -&gt; $75.77  an increase of $10.82

&amp;#x200B;

America has had increadible games prices in comparison to the rest of the world. Sony's implementation of regional pricing is completely screwing over the EU/UK/Aus and treats them as second class in comparison. This jump to next gen is pricing out gamers worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Regional pricing sucks. 

\*Used California as an example as i know it has a relatively high tax rate compared to the rest of the USA but i don't fully understand the variation in the USA. 

\*\* Used Ghost of Tsushima PSN prices to compare things to in comparison to the published Playstation blog prices for Demon Souls.",245,0.87,284,2020-09-21 03:17:12

Is 825GB enough space for you?,Tee-dus_Not_Tie-dus,"I'm curious to hear honest opinions here.  Is 825GB enough space for you?

If it's not enough space for you, why?  Do you honestly keep that many games installed at once that you ACTUALLY play?

I'm still using the 500GB drive that came in my PS4, and I keep my favorites installed just in case I decide I want to play them, and then I keep the games I'm actively playing / working on installed, and I've not really had any space issues.

The only time I had a space issue is when I recently tried to install several new games that I wanted to play eventually.  I didn't need them all installed right then, and some of them I still haven't had time to touch yet, and that issue was fixed by simply removing one old game I hadn't played in well over a year.

So, to me, I expect 825GB will be enough space for me.  I may eventually throw a 1TB or 2TB M.2 in it, but only because I can, not because I actually need to.",373,0.83,786,2020-09-20 23:27:49

In your opinion, what Playstation console or variant has the best and worst build quality up until this point?

**Best**: Original Piano Black PS3 - It just screamed luxury and premium quality. A truly beautiful console to look at.

**Worst**: All PS4 builds. They are built superbly well, but I don't like the odd shape choice and the loose plastic buttons that you can find on  nearly variant of the console.

**Afterthoughts**: I actually love the new design choice for the PS5 consoles. It's a pastiche of the 80s Mars colony buildings combined with the look of modern architecture. I think that Sony has recaptured their design magic again.",0,0.44,20,2020-09-20 21:52:18

Is God of War sequel in 2021 really too early?,Express_Ad2067,Considering God of War started development in 2014 and released in 2018. That’s a 4 year dev cycle. On top of that if you’ve seen the making of documentary then you might know how chaotic the development of God of War was. The development wasn’t supposed to start till after the new IP Santa Monica was making but it was canned and the entire team was mov d to God of War production prematurely which created a lot pipeline issues with people constantly waiting on someone else to finish something that they needed to finish something else. Not to mention Sony has said they’ve expanded their studios in an attempt to increase the frequency of releases.

PS Plus Bundle and Remasters,[deleted],"Considering there are 18 games in the bundle, 10 of which are PlayStation exclusives, does this mean those games wont be getting a remaster on PS5? I heard a lot of rumours about a Bloodborne remaster with better framerates, but if its bundled into this collection, then I cant see them making another version on top of this. On the other hand, they want to showcase some of the best games in the PS Plus collection for new players, and nobody wants to play a stuttering 30fps game on their new PS5, so maybe all 18 of these games will get a graphical and frame rate upgrade just for the PS5?

I would have expected a game like Spider-Man to be in this bundle if it wasn't for the fact its being remastered and included in the Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.

Only reason why I feel like we might get cross generation is because how many games are going cross generation this time around compared to the past. I for one don’t personally like the same game getting two trophies lists especially if they have free upgrades and it basically makes me feel like I have to replay it to get the trophies I’ve already unlocked for the past generation version.

"Digital Vs Physical Gaming? What should you choose, a little guide by me.",My_Gaming_Companion,"\_\_This is a guide, so best you read it full thoroughly to get some information and some tips. It's for new players or for those who are quite late in PS4 era who are confused deciding whether to buy PS5 digital or PS5 Physical edition? While old PS4 players are also welcomed, who knows what might change your mind?\_\_

Let's get this straight! I will be telling pros and cons of digital games, while cons being obviously pros of physical game. This guide will then proceed forward to next topic of who should switch? Ending with important NOTES.

\*\*Pros:\*\*

\*Digital games are not physical entities, therefore they are damage proof, scratch proof, water-proof, dust-proof, overall they can't be destroyed, which means in case something like natural calamity happens like a earthquake your huge physical library will just came crashing down with all your sweet games discs shattered into pieces (off topic but Nintendo users are safe from most this stuff). While over time your physical games will accumulate scratches and small damages which may render them useless or make them full of problems to play on a console as it couldn't read the disk properly.

\*Digital games are very easy to access. Imagine you want to play all your games just for fun and you have this huge ass physical library. With digital games, and with now the power of PS5 fast SSD you don't have to stand up, and sit down again and again in your couch for changing the disks just exit the game and start next one. Laziness on another level, but that's what every one wants right? But with many games you might end up using HDD which will slow down your load time, but hey! You still haven't stood up from your cozy couch, so it's a win win!

\*Digital games let's you experience a true day one launch. Imagine you have this game (CYBERPUNK 2077) and you are so hype for this you decorated your whole room with posters, changed wallpapers of your devices to that damn beautiful night city and now just waiting for the release to happen. But wait? If you have digital copy, you can just pre load the game on to your console and start playing exactly from the time the game is launched! HYPE ++, but alas you have ordered physical copy, which will take days to come. While all your fav youtubers and friends are enjoying the game while you are sitting and just waiting for your game to come. HYPE : (

\*Digital games go wherever you go! Let's say you are rich af and have over 1000 games in your library, or not so rich but still have a nice 50 games in your library. Now you are going to a vacation for few weeks to a nice spot but don't have enough space to carry all your 1000/50 games with you at once, leaving to you only mere 10-20 games you have. Well Digital games have no problem like that, no matter how many games you have you can take them with your PS5 anywhere and whenever you like, just pick up PS5 and go. (considering you have enough storage solution to store all the games, otherwise you could download them too, I mean not bad considering you don't have to worry about disks right?) Even bad when you are shifting your home you have to take headache of taking them too, and if some mishappening occurs, your disk, well goodbye.

\*\*Cons:\*\* \*Enough I guess, let's make all physical gamers too happy about themselves too!\*

\*Digital games are just yours, which means you can't lend them to your far off friends, and in case you made a bad purchase and refund system is not available or you just don't want that game anymore, well you can't resell them. With digital games your money spent is just spent and you can't get it back anyway , while physical games can be shared, re-sold, and can be given for rent, Overall you can do whatever you want , keep, throw whatever, which means you are in CONTROL! And who doesn't like being in control ?

\*Physical games have not to be downloaded again and again. Imagine you need to download a new game, but you don't have space, and you delete a digital game. But later you got some space and you need to download that 50GB game again. Well congrats! The game you just downloaded before have to be downloaded again with net you paid for. While physical games have no such things. Just insert the disc, download minor updates\*, or hell even start playing without updating the game. No need to worry about deleting a game and thinking you need to download it again. Physical games save so much data for real. (\*doesn't consider updates of modern warfare 2019). And if you live in a bad internet area, then well buying a digital console is just like Going to school without books.

\*Physical games get cheaper faster. So you are not rich af and can't own 1000 games, but you are a gamer by heart and need those sweet juicy exclusives for your ps5, and luckily you are a physical gamer! Well physical games get way faster cheaper than digital ones. Both launch at same prices, but the digital stays on that grossing 60 dollars for months. Even after a year they hardly go below 30 while physical games can be get for like 10-15 dollars from ebay. Now that's what i call a deal!(NOTE: I only took data of around first two years based on my country experience, for more time than this, digital games get way cheaper than their physical brothers most of the time, with few exceptions. Results might differ in your country so see a little statistics of prices of games)

\*Physical games are great for show-off. Now you got some guests in your house, or a annoying child who treats you like shit when you are at his home. They all see your huge gaming library in all it's glory with those physicals cases and those fancy artwork and names written in their spine reading (GRAND THEFT AUTO V). And they all just see that awestruck while you stand their smiling on your beautiful collection. With digital games, meh. If you decided to open your PS5 then it's only possible moreover those fancy cases with artworks and physical items are still no match for those digital photos (it's another level feeling to hold a game in your hands). Physical games are just good for anyone who likes to praise their collection and see them all day and say, it's beautiful, I have seen it for 5 hours now.

\*Physical version doesn't steal your digital fun right? SO yeah by spending 100 more dollars you can get a console that do both physical and digital, and if you are kind of hybrid guy, then this is a extra pros of physical version for everyone.

So that's all I guess. If there are enough please tell me, I will add them here. And I hope that answer much of your questions, so you either have decided till now which is better and what to go with. But you still confused? Well then here comes PS PLUS

\*\*PS PLUS:\*\* I tell you about how good is ps plus actually, consider reading it or skip to conclusion.

\*I intend no console war, these are just my opinion. Xbox game pass is great but that doesn't make PS PLUS weak anyday. Read full.\*

It's a subscription service which gives you 2 free games every month (oof everyone knows that, now's the real deal) For just 60 dollars a year you get 2 top titles to keep every month. Fall Guys, Morder warfare 2 remastered, Street fighter V, PUBG are some of the recent amazing games that this subscription has given. And if you are having this subscription for multiple years like 4 years then you have probably made a 100+ games library which has games even better than whole xbox game pass (except flight sim ofcourse, that game is too amazing imo to be beaten by any PS exclusive). So when you think critically PS PLUS is much more financial and give you much better games than xbox game pass. HOW? LEMME EXPLAIN!

You get two great games, say fall guys, you played it for month and then you get another games while you keep all your previous games. You can continue playing whatever you like. Like this a casual gamer will be happy with these offerings, and don't need to worry about running dry of games, and occasionally you will get top hits like uncharted 4, last of us, or hell even blood borne (GOD OF WAR isn't free until now, so get your damn horses cause it will most probably follow every other exclusive and be free before ragnarok release, only prediction though but quite undeniable). So a see you just pay 300 dollars for 5 years and get over thousands of dollar worth of games while xbox game pass for consoles cost 120 dollars a year(as it cost 10 dollars a month) i.e. 600 dollars for 5 years (holy hell) , with those extra 300 dollars you could buy so great exclusives during sale, while ultimate cost 900 dollars for 5 years . If you don't have pc, then very well, microsoft played you very well (considering some games exit the service too, and xbox live games are so bad most of the games are not even recognizable by many people). And if you have pc powerful enough to play those games, then this is ever better than PS PLUS any day handsdown. In PS PLUS games are being added in your library one by one. Now in xbox game pass they throw all games at once, and as I know you won't be playing every game right? Only 10-20 or ok even till 50. But you still paying for others game you don't play? See the point? That's the secret behind game pass successful model. No console wars here, but to proof that PS PLUS is a very great and financial subscription model for all casual gamers and that many people actually play the game they paid that 60 dollars for. You can buy just exclusives and few other top titles like cyberpunk while all other gaming needs would be fulfilled by a cheap 60 dollars subscription service which grants more than those free games for a whole year wow. See your library once, they are full of gems and you didn't even notice them. PS PLUS is literally a very great subscription service I ever came in hand with considering you not only get free games but other benefits too! (This is all obvious when you see the long run and not short run. This doesn't mean Xbox game pass is bad it's great, but I just wanna prove that PS PLUS is very great subscription model, and I love sony for this as much as I love xbox for their services)

In PS5 you get a PS+ collection which give you instant access to more games, even some you have missed in regular giveaways.

\*\*So after all this we can come to 3 conclusion:\*\* These are my opinion.

1: If you are totally new, then go with digital (but not when you have bad net. No chance. See if you have some cyber cafe or some place with fast net nearby to download games, otherwise you only have one option). Digital is only best option for casual new gamers rightaway. Sure cost of exclusives are 70 dollars? But you can either stick with you PS PLUS games, and wait for a sale, or just buy that yeah. I mean how often are exclusives released? Trust me, PS PLUS games will keep you busy for months and now you have that PS PLUS collection along with free gta online for first free months too! As you are totally new, you probably wanna buy old games which are obviously dead cheap during PS PLUS double discount sales

2: If you are PS4 gamer, and have quite small physical collection and wanna play new games rightaway, then go with digital. Prices are same for both version initially so it wouldn't bother you much. While see how many games you want from you small physical collection, sell all of those and buy digital version on sale (as they will be very cheap now, mostly).

3: If you are either rich af physical guy, or wanna buy exclusives/games for very cheap just after few months of release, go with physical. Although i would suggest try bending towards digital as i don't see physical games working for such huge budget games in future, but as for now, yeah physical PS5 edition is quite viable and you can enjoy them surely for next console genration.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*NOTES:\*\* These are some important thing i wanna share, suggest me more if you think so.

\*DriveClub digital edition is not available. So if you wanna play this game badly, go with physical or just ditch this game for good.

\*With games getting update and patches as big as MODERN WARFARE, moreover blu-ray disk achieving their capacity , it is safe to assume digital media is what everyone have to do mostly. Honestly if you could update modern warfare then you could download any game (except if your intentions are far beyond my imagination)

\*This guide as told was designed for totally new players or quite late players in PS4. Although I have gave conclusion covering as much audience available.

\*Overall you are the one to decide I just given you a direction, but ultimately you have your own decisions so make whatever suits you best. I hope I helped you significantly with this guide.

\*(Physical gamers)Also if the game is asking for mandatory update, try deleting the game, and then open your PS4 offline and then insert disk and start game upon installing. Most of the time it will work, but you just have not to go PS4 online again if you don't wanna update. But if not possible it's probably because of NOTE number 2

\*Don't Buy PSNOW and EAPLAY with PS PLUS at all. PS PLUS is great and you need just time to make a good library. Sony licensing thing is quite messed like PS5 pre-orders, and if some game is given free by EA PLAY or PS NOW, and it was previously given free on PS PLUS, the current license of PSNOW and EA PLAY will override the PS PLUS license and if the games exit the service, there are high chances your PS PLUS library game will also be gone. SO don't buy any other service as it messes all sorts of licensing things.

\*\*EXTRA TIP FOR PLAYERS WHO READ TILL LAST:\*\* Hmm did I wrote this good or you felt click baited?

Ok, now time for a extra tip which is legal (ooh!) and might be life savior. For all you players who read till here, cause that's what heroes do right?

Say you got a whole bunch of library of digital games. But one day you do something and you get permanently banned, and literally you become now broke af, frustrated af, and angry af. But all of that could be prevented, if you did this one thing.

First of all make two legal accounts on PSN (by legal I mean everything you enter should be 100% accurate and no faking of anything, seriously). One with which you purchase games, and another with which you will play games now. Log both accounts in to your PS4. Now with you main account, buy games , PS PLUS membership and set it as primary. And with your play account play your games. Now if you get banned you will lose all your game progress. But hey those sweet games and your PS PLUS library are still saved in your another account right? Make another account and play your games (again from starting though, rip my 2000 hours in SKRIM)

However I honestly condemn racial shit and slurs, in online gaming. If you do it, you are the lowest scum in this earth. However I found out this method because company can ban you many times for no obvious reason, and then we have nothing to do except remorse.

So this was my method, it's working great from 2 years for me. And it will do so cause it's not illegal to buy games in an account and don't play it in it lol? And hope this method will make you feel more good about buying digital games, as it was considered one of the biggest problems of digital gaming, that your whole library is r/whoooshed if you get banned. That's why I didn't state it as a pros or con, cause here is the solution (for anyone wondering). And save files are lost both in physical and digital method as they are tied to your account.

So that's it all I had to share. I hope it was much helpful for you, and I hope you have a great next gen gaming experience. Was having free time so decided to spend it by helping others.

When I heard about the ps4 backwards compatibility and the Playstation Plus Collection, I knew I was getting a ps5 for sure (was debating between that or the Series X). My issue is that while I do think Sony will have a decent stock for launch and for Christmas, my concern is that there will be a potential shortage of the system like with the Switch earlier this year, and the super fast pre-orders didn't calm my nerves either.

One of the things I appreciate most about the PS showcases lately in terms of game variety...,assbutt_Angelface,"They've spent a decent portion of time looking at games that are family friendly or more kid focused. For example, Kena, Sackboy, and Bugsnax, while some of these have not yet been rated they all seem to be family adventures. It's nice to see some level of commitment to having these sort of games on the system and putting them in the forefront. So often it feels like  the Nintendo console is the only place to go for this in a generation. I can remember there being a lot of big games like this in the PS1/2 era, but as time has gone on, the ps3/4 trended more adult in what they were pushing.

Does the PS5 launch remind you of the PS2?,MetroidPrimeMaster,"Does anyone else get that weird, nostalgic feeling from the days of the PS2 launch? I remember growing up the PS2 was so elusive and wanted because it literally did everything (playing DVDs). While 4K Blu-ray isn't as big compared to media 20 years ago, Sony is literally using the same advertising tactics and marketing push for the PS5. I have to say, it's got me quite excited as a whole.

While I have always liked other consoles and handhelds too, Sony has a penchant for hitting the right marketing notes.

"PSVR might not work with the new PS5 HD camera, so maybe keep hold of your old PS4 camera.",BitcoinBoffin,"As the old saying goes: ""To assume is to make an ass of u &amp; me."" So forgive me if I've assumed others have just maybe missed the finer details on Playstation Cameras, HD or otherwise as I think I have.

According to a careful reading of the [accessories section on Sony's own PS5 page](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/ps5/accessories/) it details the new PS5 ""HD camera"" with zero mention of it's use with PSVR. However immediately below the link that takes you to the [PS5 HD camera's own page (which also has zero mention of it's use with PSVR)](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/accessories/hd-camera/) is the following text: 


""PlayStation®Camera adaptor

Connect your PlayStation®VR to your PS5 console to enjoy supported PS VR games. To set up your PS VR with your PS5 console you'll need your PlayStation Camera* for PS4™ and a PlayStation Camera adaptor (no purchase necessary). More details on how to claim an adaptor will be shared on PlayStation.com when available.


*Model CUH-ZEY1(Square PS4 camera) or CUH-ZEY2(Round PS4 camera)""


This will be unfortunate if it turns out to be correct as I was hoping the higher 1080x1920 resolution PS5 HD camera might go some of the way to help to resolve PSVR's tracking &amp; jutter issues.


TL:DR

If you are going to be using your PSVR with your new PS5, keep hold of your PS4 camera in case the new PS5 camera is incompatible with PSVR.",16,0.67,25,2020-09-19 20:11:42
