Microsoft is making a mistake in not implementing gyro aiming.,walrusplant,"Gyro aiming is a way of minimizing the precision gap between controllers versus mouse&amp;keyboard. The use of gyro aiming doesn't replace the the right joystock, but instead is used merely for fine-tuning. For those unfamiliar, here are a few videos illustrating in different ways its surprising potential for shooter games:

————

[\[Halo with gyro aiming\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqaz6SxnwnI&amp;t=1s)

[\[Linus Tech Tips\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qlZmXnE1mw)

[\[Motion Controls and the Rejection of Progress\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=binPB4YbWmM&amp;ab_channel=Nerrel)

————

 Unfortunately, gyro aiming is often misunderstood. Here are common arguments I see against it, and why they aren't compelling:

**[1] I wouldn't use it.** That's fine. But others would like to, and making it optional can leave everyone happy.

**[2] It shouldn't be mandatory.** To my knowledge, no shooter has ever made gyro aiming mandatory.

**[3] It would be expensive.** Gyro sensors are relatively inexpensive and woudn't require any novel technology.

**[4] It hinders accessibility.** More options increases accessibility.

**[5] It's a gimmick.** Gyro aiming requires minimal movement and provides enhanced precision, unlike certain previous implementations of motion controls that have rightly been regarded as gimmicky.

**[6] Not enough people care about it.** That's quickly changing as more and more people come to realize its potential.

————

On the other hand, there are downsides to omitting gyro aiming:

* Joysticks are intrinsically limited for aiming; gyro aiming enables a finer degree of precision. That fine-tunes the controls, enhances player agency, and raises the skill ceiling without necessarily raising the skill floor.

* In games that enable crossplay between controllers and M&amp;K, such as **Halo**, gyro aiming reduces the need to give console players a significant handicap via auto-aim.

* In games that enable crossplay between different console platforms, such as **Apex Legends**, the implementation of gyro aiming in other consoles may put Xbox players at a disadvantage.

————

Microsoft has been making a lot of exciting moves recently. But it's disappointing that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on one of the most promising ways of moving console gaming forward, especially given Xbox's strength with first-person shooters and (now) first-person RPGs. I think leaving out gyro-aiming this generation is a mistake, and one whose impact has been underappreciated by the Xbox community.

If you feel persuaded, I suggest reaching out to Xbox via social media and expressing a desire for a gyro sensor controller in the future.",0,0.44,9,2020-10-01 21:57:11

An lesser spoken about advantage that Xbox has (Shooters),PoderickPayne,"I feel this was already the case, but one aspect the Zenimax purchase really drove home for me, when looking at getting a Series X, or a PS5 was just how much more of a First Person Shooter friendly machine the Xbox is.  If that is your top genre, what you will be getting from that console and gamepass is just incredible

\- 7 Halo titles, with an 8th on the way that's free with Gamepass, day and date

\- Eventually all the Dooms and Wolfensteins, as well as any upcoming new enrties, day and date

\- Battlefield Bad Company, Bad Company 2, BF3, BF4 and BF1 as well as both Titanfalls in EA Play

\- A better online service, for multiplayer and co-op

\- The Elite controller is awesome for shooter games

\- Series X will be the better console for higher, more consistent frame rates

Sony's exclusives are basically two genres.  JRPG's and 3rd Person Action/Adventure.  Sometimes open world, sometimes more linear.  And if you like those types of games, that's great.  You get a lot of good ones there.  But if you're mainly a shooter fan like me, Sony offers you nothing in that category.  Xbox is the clear choice for shooters",2,0.6,6,2020-10-01 21:32:14

I have been with PS from the start PS PS2 PS3 PS4 and I am switching to Xbox for this gen here is why btw yes Bethesda was the clincher!,tzinc,"(1) Backwards Compatibility not just to the previous Gen. 

(2) You can use any XBOX Controller. 

(3) Cheaper 1st Party Games 

(4) Their digital console Series S is cheaper and the only difference is it has to upgrade to 4k and half the space. Also in Canada their Disc Version Series X is cheaper.

(5) Better machine specs. 

(6) Has traditional exclusives like Halo Gear Forza plus bringing in Fable, 

(7) Has new exclusives like Hellblade 2 The Initiative Etc Etc 

(8) Will have Bethesda exclusives (you don't pay 7 billion and not make the games exclusive). Doom Wolfenstein. Fallout. Skyrim. Doom, and new franchise Starfield. 

(9) Has a payment plan to make it affordable and cheaper. (9) Has the best cloud service (Sony is paying them to use it). 

(10) Game pass 1st party games can be played plus many 3rd party games and EA Play is included for free. 

(11) Plus you can play Game Pass across different devices. (

12) Has not engaged in takedowns of youtube and twitter accounts critical of their games like Sony did with LoU2. Not only attacking free speech but hurting people's incomes. Also has not engaged in hypocritical blurring of games like Sony did for Japanese games but not for LoU2.  


VS.  


Sony has some good exclusives (Like I said MS learned and they bought up studios including one of the biggest studios in the world in Bethesda). XBOX is creating many new exclusives to compete with SONY plus will have many established games as exclusives.  I am NOT an Xbox fanboy. I have been PS PS2 PS3 and when MS was very anti-consumer I went PS4. Now Sony is anti-consumer. I am not a hypocrite.  


As for the SONY exclusives: Ghosts is a good game but how different can it be in future editions? GoW is a good game as is Horizons. LoU2 was a disaster. Uncharted ended with the weakest game in the series. Spiderman Morales is not even a new game. The exclusives were great in the last gen but they are less than enthralling so far in next Gen.   


Horizon 2 and GoW 2 and maybe Ghosts 2 vs Forza Gears Halo Fable Fallout Doom Wolfernstein Starfield Hellblade 2 Skyrim no contest. Xbox was already the best consumer company this gen and was already the best choice but buying Bethesda ended all discussion.",4,0.53,17,2020-10-01 12:00:41

What the current/back compat titles that you're looking forward to experiencing on Series X/S?,TsukiMine,"Obviously some people are very one &amp; done with their games which is cool. I tend to replay a lot because when I was young I got a Gameboy Colour &amp; Pokemon Red for Christmas/Birthday...and just thought it was the Pokemon machine, didn't realize there was anything else on it &gt;\_&gt;

So! What games are you looking forward to experiencing at their best performance (either higher res, unlocked fps etc)? Either to revisit an old favourite or for the first time.

For me: Ninja Gaiden Black (if it comes back to Games Pass one day). I'm garbage at character action stuff but enjoy them a lot. Deus Ex HR/MD, really love immersive sims (the og Deus Ex is one of my fav games). Dishonored ofc. Gears would be fun, I enjoyed what I played of 5 more than I played of 4. MCC feels obvious, really hopeful of Infinite after playing 5 at a friends and uhh. not enjoying it that much &gt;\_&gt; Resident Evil 7 &amp; the Remakes of 1 + 2...idk, there's probably lots.

I find the Game Pass library on the Xbox website a bit weird, there's no genre filters etc and collections are incredibly limited...but yeah. lots of things to loook forward to!

I'm not much of a Rockstar fan, not anti them or anything, but just for whatever reason their titles have never clicked too much. As much as RDR2 looks pretty it doesn't l;ook like my thing for whatever reason but if it was on Games Pass I'd probably try it at least",4,0.7,29,2020-10-01 18:42:50

Pick one game to come to the series X,alexmason32,"Pick a game that you love that isn’t BC to come to the series X. It can be on any system and from any year. You can only pick one but it’ll come to the SX and you can finally enjoy it on a modern console.

Jet Set Future seems like an obvious candidate. However, we do have Jet Set Radio already on BC 

A non HD collection version of Silent Hill would be great. However, Konami WOULD put the originals on if they could, since they put literally every one that came to 360 on the system, it’s just they won’t pay to have proper versions remade since the source code was lost.

So, Crazy Taxi 3. Yes a bit of an odd choice but think about it. It’s confined to the original Xbox, relatively unknown compared to its famous prequel and wouldn’t be that hard to bring over to the SX. Even if there were some music cuts we could at least remedy that with Spotify.

Destroy All Humans 2 is another good candidate but to be fair that is on PS4 so it is on modern consoles. 

Also they should bring the Stalker games over in preparation for Stalker 2. They’re readily available on Steam but a console port would be nice.

Microsoft deserves praise for Smart Delivery,NdibuD,"When Smart Delivery first broke cover lots of people claimed it was just a buzz word and that MS was overhyping an already available feature (cross-buy).

Now however the simplicity and convenience of Smart Delivery is becoming evident as more and more games on PS5 are being announced as incompatible with their PS4 counterparts' game saves.

Every single Smart Delivery games not only allows you to play an upgraded game on Series X|S (in most cases for free) but also allows you to pick up where you left off on your current gen console and that is just swell!

This is great if you want to keep your current gen console as a bedroom console where you can continue playing where you left off without any hassle whatsoever guaranteed!

The games that don't support this on PS5 so far are Maneater, Dirt 5 and Yakuza Like a Dragon. There are surely more to come!

Anyone else super excited at the prospect of knowing that all your friends have the same Multiplayer games if you're all on Game Pass?,NeedsMoreShawarma,"I think this is going to be a game changer going forward. For example once Halo Infinite releases, if you and your friends are all on Game Pass, you can all just jump in. We've never had anything like that before. 

I also think for smaller multiplayer games, I could see them have a much easier time building and keeping healthy playerbases longer, or turning into big hits over time as word-of-mouth spreads because freaking **everyone** on Game Pass has access to it and tells their friends and so on. 

It's probably the thing that's got me the most hyped tbh.

"Mod applications, BIG rule changes, and a look ahead | State of the Subreddit | September 30th, 2020",joshsekhon,"Hey everyone,

What a crazy September it’s been. From the Series S reveal, to the pre-orders, and of course the Bethesda news. It’s been a spectacular month for Xbox and our community. We’ve gained more than 70,000 new members over the course of the last month, and generated over 10 million page views. As the community expands, we’re going to have to adapt our rules and practices to make sure that we’re promoting high quality Xbox discussion. With that said, in this state of the sub you’ll find info on our:

* New Moderator Applications (for Reddit &amp; Discord)
* Some big changes to our ruleset
* A quick note regarding our wiki
* Some general housekeeping notes

**New Moderator Applications**

The last time we brought on new mods was more than a month ago, and considering the sub has more than doubled in size since, we’re opening mod apps up again. Currently we are looking to add community members from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia because we’ve had a couple things slip through the cracks during peak times for those regions (likely because we were all asleep). Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply if you’re in North or South America, but we do need more coverage in other time zones.

[Here’s the mod application if you’re looking to join the Reddit team.](https://forms.gle/YBCu3FEMfDCfnWS46)

If you’re interested in joining our Discord, we've recently gotten our vanity url, so be sure to share it to your friends: [https://discord.gg/xboxseries](https://discord.gg/xboxseries) 

[We're also looking for new mods on Discord as well, so here is the application for that.](https://forms.gle/6YCXUunp6ExhWb7h9)

If you’ve applied in the past for either position, you’ll have to do so again. These applications are quite a bit more comprehensive than the ones we used before, so be sure to familiarize yourself with the new rules before applying.

**New Rules**

Speaking of new rules, they’re already live, courtesy of some excellent work done by some excellent mods. They are visible in the sidebar (about tab on mobile), but be sure to read the full descriptions located in our [rules wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/rules). From the feedback we've been seeing, our community is primarily interested in news, discussion, and even the occasional meme from time to time. We want our rules and moderation practices to reflect that.

We apologize to anyone that uses this sub as resource for support and advice, but an overwhelming majority of ""support posts"" that we've seen are typically easy to locate on whatever search engine you prefer, or cannot be answered by anyone other than Xbox Support.

As we always do, we'll be gauging community interest over the course of the next month to see how you feel about the new rules, and we'll make any changes if needed.

**Wiki Revamp**

First and foremost, it's come to our attention that the FAQs aren’t the easiest to navigate for mobile users (which is an overwhelming majority of you). Over the course of the next few weeks we’ll be revamping the wiki pages to make them easier to navigate so that you can easily find the content that you’re looking for.

Even though there will be more restrictions relating to any posts requiring assistance (be it pre-order, tv, or Game Pass advice), we're committed to expanding our wiki as a means of providing you with the resources you may need.

Recently we had u/Xbox_Live_User &amp; u/Shannonxtreme post an awesome [Beginner's Guide to XSX/XSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/j12q3u/beginners_guide_to_xsxxss_game_pass_storage_and/), containing some answers to a bunch of FAQs that we just never got around to adding on our wiki pages because of all the ~~pre-order~~ September craziness. We’re happy to say we’ll be adding all that awesome information to our Wiki Pages in the near future.

If you have anything that you'd like to add to the Wiki/FAQs, feel free to [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/XboxSeriesX) them to us or submit them in the #subreddit-suggestions channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xboxseries), and we'll be sure to review them for approval.

**General Housekeeping**

Now for the usual housekeeping notes:

If you’re looking for a group of people to play with from our community, in addition to the #LFG channel on our Discord, you can join our [Xbox Community Club](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/clubs/profile?clubid=3379835037462437). Not only can you use it to play with people from across the community, but we’ll be using it in the near future to coordinate community game nights and events along those lines. If you’re interested in any of that, it’s definitely worth your time.

Perhaps the most significant change you’ll find in this State of the Sub, Automod will no longer be commenting on every post. It will be used specifically around important events that drive more traffic to the community such as launch day, and the release of a big XGS title. ~~We know this is a change that many of you have been requesting, so I fully expect this State of the Sub to generate like a million upvotes—or we might just have to re-activate it…I don’t know.~~

That’s all for now. Comments, questions, concerns, suggestions, or any feedback in general, let us know in the comments below—or reach out to us via [ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/XboxSeriesX) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xboxseries).

Advice on Backwards Compatible Call of Duty games?,ElmoPitts,"Hi all,

I've only ever owned Nintendo and Playstation consoles, but this generation I'm making a switch! I preordered a new Xbox. I'm really excited for Xbox's backwards compatibility, especially because my playstation consoles never allowed me to play older games.

So I think I want to buy one of the old call of duty games, like BO1, BO2 or MW3. I was wondering if anyone has any experience as to which games are the most populated and have the least amount of hackers?

The benefits of Dolby Vision HDR,BB8XSBW,"There were several people in the Dolby Vision announcement thread who were unaware of what the format does, so here's a summary:

**Features**

* Like HDR10, Dolby Vision is a high dynamic range video format based on the PQ EOTF, and so both formats support up to 10,000 nits of brightness. In fact, HDR10 was also developed by Dolby. They gave it away royalty free for everyone to use, but they charge a fee for manufacturers or content creators who want to utilize Dolby Vision, which is a more premium format.

* It supports up to 12 bit color depth, whereas HDR10 only supports up to 10 bit.

* It supports dynamic metadata on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis, which optimizes the tone mapping of your display for each scene or frame. HDR10 supports only static metadata, which remains the same for every scene.

* Supports ICtCp color model which improves chroma subsampling versus ycbcr

One misconception among some people is that there is no benefit to sending a 12 bit signal when consumer UHD displays only support up to 10 bit. [Here](https://youtu.be/GnRdJQMf6C0?t=269) is a video that addresses this. This benefit has been observed on UHD Blu-rays that support Dolby Vision. In some cases, the 12 bit signal can clean up noise in the image that is found in the HDR10 version of the same movie, even though it's only being displayed on a 10 bit display.

The dynamic metadata should help increase specular highlight &amp; shadow detail, as well as the ability to better attain the desired level of contrast and saturation, in order to better match the creative intent of developers.

In short: Dolby Vision will give you the best possible HDR experience when playing games.",55,0.82,82,2020-10-01 02:56:32

Has Xbox fully redeemed itself for you yet?,alexmason32,"Obviously we’ll all get the Series X but we remember the rough launch of the XB1. Things are much better now and we’re trying to move past the ugly mistakes. Many of us see the Series X as the possible true return to from for Xbox.

Gamepass being what it is

Exclusives actually picking up steam 

Old IPs being revived

Hardware that’s worth the launch price

Features that *aren’t* on PC (preloading games you don’t own, quick resume from multiple games) 

Game streaming that’s practically free (considering it was added on to GP at no additional costs)

EA Play’s library giving us even more games than we can play

Surprisingly great storage options (even if you can’t play Series X games on HDD you can at least store them

4K Player so it’s really is a great entertainment machine

And even a cost friendly option for those of us who are content with digital games.

If they added in picture in picture (the best if admittedly overkill feature) and gave a basic $5 multiplayer only gold option, then really, the Series X will beat out the PS5 imo.

Of course both are great systems, the PS5 has more accessible exclusives and a more interesting controller. 

And yes microsoft is still a company with a “bottom line is the dollar sign” mentality, yes they aren’t actually our friends and corporate business can be appalling. 

However, Xbox has still been a great thing for many of us. We’ve met good friends through Xbox, it got us through bad times and if you’re playing Xbox you’re staying outta trouble (okay unless you’re avoiding studying or work). 

Has Xbox fully redeemed itself for you yet? Had it not been for all of these improvements the answer imo would be no. However, showing an effort to change for the better and showing you’ve improved, is what qualifies you for redemption.

And XBSX seems to be doing just that.",3,0.54,63,2020-09-30 13:51:14

Xbox One - Missed Gems,aiKaiz,"After such a long time... the Series X has drawn me back to the Microsoft realm. 

I had gone with Sony PS4, since the One didn't interest me too much, and I had a 360- wanted to give something else a try and get the Little Big Planet games... but I only ended up having around 10 games on PS4, and even less on PS3... while I had around 100 on 360 (thanks, EBGames &amp; Blockbuster.)

So now, I'm coming back. The GPU is way too tempting at this point- especially if you're on a tight budget. Most of the games I want on PS5 (which 90% are PS4 games...) are on the XSX (or One.) Plus, Halo was my childhood! 

So now, I gotta know- what gems did I miss out on for the Xbox One? I'm planning on doing a ""Playd Run"" at my local EBGames!

Does anyone know how long Microsoft prevents you from redeeming a Game Pass 1-month trial after you’ve already used one?,TheClownIsReady,"I bought a One X about 2 years ago and redeemed the Game Pass trial code that came with it. I returned the console due to some issues. A few months later I tried again with a new console, but the Game Pass code would not redeem...it said I’d already used up my trial.

I’m getting the Series X on launch day. I assume another Game Pass code will be bundled with it. Since it’s been more than 12 months since I last redeemed a Game Pass trial, will it essentially “reset” the opportunity for me to begin a new trial or does MS consider you blocked from *ever* redeeming another one?",0,0.2,10,2020-09-30 05:30:12

Game pass is an even better deal for people living in countries outside the USA,ATR2400,"Hello. I’m a Canadian Xbox user who’s stuck with Xbox since the 360. I already got my preorder on day 2(at a busy mall strangely enough). I just wanted to say something.


Most of the discussion on this sub is from people on the USA. Lots of references to $60 games and all that. For us non-Americans with weaker currencies than the US dollar, Game pass is an even better deal for us than it is for you. One Canadian dollar is only 74 cents to every American dollar. It doesn’t sound like much, but it definitely adds up over time. What is a $60 game for you ends up being $80+ for us, and special editions can often go over $100. This means that we have to be a bit more careful when deciding what games we want to buy and sometimes we have to wait longer before we can buy them.


Game pass allows us to play the games we want for a much lower price overall. Because game pass is already pretty cheap per month, the exchange rate issue doesn’t harm the wallet as much as 60 American dollars converted to 80 of our money does. 

For only 12USD per month, or if you want, a yearly subscription, we don’t have to pay exorbitant prices on games.


Because of this, I really think gamepass is going to take off in a lot of counties where weaker currencies makes purchasing games more expensive.",62,0.87,76,2020-09-29 23:46:11

Microsoft Employees/Alumni limited to one Series X *or* S console at employee pricing,mreed911,"I'm a Microsoft alumni from the 90's.  I keep my membership up to get access to the company store (and for the friends/family passes, since my family is mostly Xbox as well).  I logged in today and finally saw the Series X / Series S preorders available (the employee store launches products AFTER the public launch - customers first!).

There was a note on the listing(s) that you could buy ONE series console - X or S - period.  Not one of each.  One.  ""Duplicate orders will be canceled.""

I only NEED one (and the X is already ""notify me when available"" while the S is ""pre-order now!""), but it's also nice to see that there won't be hoarding/pumped-up-resale happening from MSFT employees/alumni.  They definitely want these in the hands of the public.

Also of note, the pay-over-time option wasn't available, primarily because the employee store also discounts GPU, so there probably wasn't a way to discount the pay-monthly option to match.

Storage: 
1tb Internal Storage with 802gb Free after OS- Series X. 512gb Internal Storage - Series S. Unknown OS size. (may vary from SX) 
Expandable storage - 1tb Seagate Custom $219.99
All Series X games OR series X enhanced games must be PLAYED via these two. Internal/Custom Expandable Storage. They can be downloaded and stored on ANY usb HDD and transferred when you are wanting to play. You can unhook your current external HDD, plug into series consoles and begin playing immediately. Back compatibility games NOT enhanced can be played from the external HDD but will NOT benefit directly from the SSD speeds. 
I'd recommend any game to be transferred to internal or Seagate Custom Expandable Storage to access better loading times and potentially reduce stutter in some games. Plugging an existing HDD into either console and transferring games back and forth would nearly eliminate the need for buying the Expandable Seagate Custom NVME. 

BackCompat: 
All games from xbox one excluding Kinect games will be playable day 1. Discs and digital can be used as they are now. Selected titles (unannounced) will benefit from software HDR that's built in to Series. 
Frame rates will selectively be doubled, any games with dynamic resolution and uncapped framerate will benefit most. -See digital foundry video for results- 

The existing xbox 360 and Xbox games on Xbox one will also be available Series day 1. Non Series Enhanced back compat games can be played via external HDD and will still receive HDR support if the title was approved by Microsoft. 

Xbox Series S will NOT play Xbox One X enhancements. Back compatibility may go into doubling the framerates of older titles as MSoft stated they are working on a process that allows them to bypass developers to increase framerates in some games. 

Smart Delivery: 
SS or SX will AUTOMATICALLY download the correct version of each game. Series X will receive the One X enhanced patch OR a further Series X Enhanced patch. Series S will get One S games and not One X patched games. You do nothing. Literally nothing. Just download the game and Smart Delivery makes sure you got the right one. 

HDMI 2.1: 
This allows consoles to output 4k Resolution at 120hz. Hdmi 2.1 is compatible with ALL hdmi displays and  hdmi 2.1 is not needed for 1440p at 120hz. This is supported by Hdmi 2.0. 
If your tv is 4k/60 and 1440p/1080p 120hz then I would not suggest an upgrade. Simply set your Console to output 1440p and then select 120hz. 

The resolution of the game will not change depending on the resolution OUTPUT of your console. The Devs determine resolution and if a game is running at 4k, and you output 1440p, it will Super Sample on to a 1440p display. What this means is the 4k image will be ""compressed"" into a 1440p image giving it a much sharper detail than a traditional 1440p resolution GAME output. This is the exact same for 1080p displays. Both will benefit from th extra power because the image on screen will be much cleaner and sharper than a traditional 1080p/1440p. To restate - 120hz TV's that are not hdmi2.1 will still run 120hz at a lower resolution via console settings. 120hz games will always, always, have a 60hz mode. If that's all your tv can do then you will be fine picking that mode. You will not be allowed to play 120hz on a tv or monitor that does not support 120hz. I've seen it mentioned and that's just not the way the world works. 

Accessories: 
All existing Xbox One controllers will be forward compatible with Series. Controllers will also be updated to support Low Latency that comes with Series Controllers. Low latency Input support improves the time at which the action of a button/trigger/ bumper is shown on screen. This is amplified by higher refresh rates. I.e 120hz with LLI would be Optimal for shooters/racing games. It will feel extraordinarily different from current gen. 

""Microsoft has confirmed that all previous accessories will carry forward from the Xbox One to the next-gen Xbox Series X. This includes everything from your headsets, USB storage drives, mice and keyboards, webcams, and controllers, as well as the Elite Series 2 controller launched in 2019.""
-Exclude's Kinect as it will no longer be supported. 

Audio:
Dolby Atmos Support 
Project Accoustics- works with any headset/tv/speakers. Not much is known but it's similar in capacity to Atmos Directional support in games without the need for Atmos specific Speakers/Headsets.  

Resolution/FPS/Machine learning:
4k Target for most games for SX- 1440p for SS. 
30 fps will still be used in games heavy with Ray tracing. 
60fps will become a more standard.
120hz for shooters, racing games will become increasingly common as the generation goes on. This mode will likely NOT use Ray tracing or higher resolutions. Remember- Resolution DOES NOT equal visual fidelity. 
Dynamic resolution will most likely be used for higher fps games as well as games targeting 60 with Ray Tracing. Machine learning has not been shown but  it's benefits would be to render a game at a lower resolution and using a machine learning algorithm would output at a higher resolution that does save performance . So please, throw fake 4k out of your vocabulary as it is not necessary or needed. It can be argued that it's a waste of resources when ML can do as good/better while allows assets to be turned up. Dlss2.0 is a good starting point. 

Talking point- 

Crossgen/Legacy/Pop in/ Series S: 
Talking points that crossgen games will hinder games for next gen. This is a fact that cannot be over ruled but it's application may have misunderstandings. SSDs do not, I repeat, do NOT make pop in a thing of the past. Not enough GPU resources or CPU resources account for pop in and short draw distances. Games built with weaker CPUs in mind and slower hard drives are moreso limiting those at a coding level and DESIGN level than they would if they were shooting above next gen specs and dialing down to fit the system parameters. Building for an SSD can extend the world size from ""hundreds of kilometers"" to "" hundreds of thousands of kilometers"" as seen in star citizen and is done without a single loading screen. I.e. I can land on a planet after flying through space in real time -no cutscenes- and walk around a planet that's scaled to life size as a man would go and walk on our moon. It's impressive and the scope at which games can be in size alone make leaving last gen behind necessary. It can also enable devs to push out lods further from ground up while eliminating loading from walking into a room, other area of a map that's ""closed"" off. 
SSDs will not drastically reduce game size genuinely because games that are designed for them... Will be bigger with more assets! And higher level assets at that. Series S will not have game files as large since there is no need for 4k assets on a 1440p system. Also, the idea floating around That series S will hold back next gen is flawed and 100% false. Games designed with SSD's and Faster CPUs can always, i repeat, ALWAYS be cut down to fit a GPU. Especially one that has brand new architecture and isnt from the Early 2000s. 

Games: 
Not a huge amount of launch titles. But I am saying simply, have patience. Most big studios were acquired 2 years ago and another monster last week. 
Enjoy games for now, enjoy the benefits of the new system on older games, and upcoming titles. Even if they aren't true next gen yet - there will be a big difference from One X to SX or One S to SS. 
An argument can be even made that One X to SS would be beneficial as you do get the added speed of the SSD and FPS in certain titles. Preference folks. Allll preference. 

Been working on this for a while.  I'm sure I've missed something and if someone would like to add anything please by all means let me know. I've seen the same questions Over and over and wanted to try and make something that's not a graph and hopefully in terms easy enough to understand. Many things will be personal preference that I didn't add in (games, what system should you buy) etc and I will leave that to choice.",26,0.78,4,2020-09-29 23:16:08

What I hope for Xbox Series X,Chromeeatpoop,"In the past few years, we saw consoles like Xbox and PS4 go from an experience that gave us countless hours of fun together to a singleplayer, online-based platform. If that was all we wanted, why would we spend all that money on games, devices, and online membership instead of just switching to pc? Console was meant to have split-screen and it shows in the success of consoles like the Nintendo switch. I aim this argument particularly at the new generation of Xbox. All of their titles are going to be available on pc and even mobile! What is the point of me going out and spending $500 where I can just buy game-pass for pc? If the Series-X doesn't have the classic split-screen feeling of the 360 days, there is legitimately no point in me buying one. I cant see it in any other way than Xbox killing their console before it even releases! Bring us back to the times where we would play with our friends and (for me) siblings side by side for hours.

My take on Xbox's strategy this gen,ActualWolverine,"The more I think about the common reasons for the Bethesda acquisition, the less sense it makes. Why the heck would they spend $7.5B to get Zenimax? 

To make their games exclusive to xbox and bolster gamepass? That isn't worth a full $7.5B. Surely they could have paid a billion or 2 to permanently add all current Zenimax games to gamepass and make all new Zenimax games for a couple of years exclusive to xbox, and they would have had like $6B left, which could for example, lower the xsx cost by $150 for 40 million consoles.

Then for the game engines and tech like doom's id tech? No, Microsoft is the number 1 software company in the world, and they made directx, so surely they could make a decent game engine.

And I don't think Zenimax will pay for itself this generation either. They only made like 20 games this generation. Even if they release all of their games on ps5, I still don't think they'll manage to pay for themselves at least for this generation.

That being said, there are still many reasons for this acquisition, but none of them involve short term profit. I don't think Microsoft cares about making money from xbox, at least for the time being. I think they care more about just having marketshare. Aaron Greenberg said that gamepass doesn't make microsoft a lot of money. 

And also, Microsoft has no reason to release their games on pc. You might say ""But you're still playing on a microsoft platform, windows, and you're still paying for the game,"" Yeah, but how often do you pay for windows? And individual xbox exclusives only make a minuscule amount of money compared to having you on xbox and getting 30% of every purchase you make or on windows store which no one uses for anything other than gamepass. The point isn't to make money. It's to create good will and brand loyalty by over-delivering on value and being consumer friendly.

If Microsoft didn't care about being consumer friendly, they could've absolutely screwed over ps5. If xbox stopped supporting pc, did my theoretical $2B Zenimax deal, and sold xbox series x for $400 by subsidizing with $4B of the remaining $6B and spent the last $2B on locking up every 3rd party exclusive they could, they could absolutely ruin sony. But MS doesn't want that. They might seem like competitors on the surface, but they're business partners. They don't want to kill each other. Sony uses Microsoft Azure for Psnow, and gamepass is about to add 2 free months of funimation, which is owned by sony.

Microsoft really does think it's real competitors are facebook, google, and amazon. I think this is the real reason why MS cares so much about xcloud. Google stadia might seem like a blunder, but google doesn't really care that much about gaming. They're tech giants that have enough money to do whatever they want on a whim. So what happens when they do start caring? They're gonna start buying up these massive game studios and publishers left and right. When that happens, Microsoft wants Sony and nintendo on their side, which does make me think that these bethesda games might actually come to ps5, not for slightly more revenue like some wishful thinkers might think, but to keep the good will of Sony. 

So back to the reasons why Microsoft bought Zenimax, there's a multitude. Aside from the obvious reasons of more gamepass games and a better first party studios, a huge aspect is for the PR. Microsoft wants everyone, both gamers, and competitors to know they're serious about gaming, and to remind everyone of Microsoft's scale. They bought all of it in cash, not a combination of cash and stock like most acquisitions of this scale. People forget that MS is worth $1.5 trillion, compared to Sony's $115B and Nintendo's $40B. It's a scare tactic against facebook, google, and amazon that this is the scale of investment they'll need to do to enter this market, and it makes sure they don't manage to get Zenimax. This might also attract more 3rd party devs after seeing how heavily invested MS is in gaming and how willing they are to pay.",0,0.22,21,2020-09-29 18:12:26

Xbox Series S survival over time,guyjolico,"Hi everyone,

I’m a current PlayStation user with a PS5 digital edition pre order. 

I enjoy Sony’s exclusive but I’m mainly on PS due to all my friends being on that platform. 

When Microsoft announced the acquisition of Bethesda, I pre ordered a XSX.

Now when I’m thinking about it, I’m not really interested in paying $600+ for a second system (I’m in Canada) so I have seriously been considering ordering a XSS whenever it becomes available again. 

The main games I’m looking to use the XSS for are Starfield, TES6, Avowed, Fable 4 and Forza. 

My only concern is, given the specs of that console, is it going to be able to keep up with how demanding games are becoming? And will it be able to survive this entire consol generation?

Thank you!

I feel like this would cause confusion, because I wouldn’t know if I was playing a Xbox One or Xbox Series X game, there would be no way to tell?

Xbox Series X GPU performance in Backwards Compatibility...,juanmamedina,"[https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1310638993973878785?s=20](https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1310638993973878785?s=20)

Based on this tweet from Digital Foundry, the console, when running in backwards compatibility mode, runs it's 12.15 Tflops in a GCN-based mode, this means that the console performance in backwards compatibility is around **RX Vega 64/RTX 2060 Super/RX 5700** level of performance.

But don't panic, the performance seen in DF video doesn't even enables the IPC improvements on RDNA 2, (let's not even talk about VRS) the expected IPC improvements are between 50% (RDNA1.0 like) and 60% over GCN, which leaves the console over the level of an **RTX 2080 Super** in the worst case scenario (+50% IPC over GCN).

"According to Ars, the matte finish of the XSX is very sensitive",Essentialredditor," 

&gt;But like a primped leather jacket ensemble, the matte-black face of Xbox Series X doesn't look as good if it's not handled correctly. For starters, the finish is very sensitive to scuffs and marks. I found this out when posing Series X for an Ars photo gallery last week, with some of my photos including an iconic controller-on-top pose. While taking those photos, I slid the packed-in Xbox controller across one of the console's longer sides. I only did this once.  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet, this Series X is now permanently scratched with three thin but clearly visible scratch marks. Microsoft, did you seriously not think about people putting the two things in the Series X box—the console and the controller—against each other, and test what happens when they do?  
&gt;  
&gt;There's also the matter of fingerprints. If you can imagine yourself regularly picking up and moving a Series X around your home, even your cleanest fingerprints will still leave a trace of mild finger-oil residue—arguably because you'll want to carefully grip the 9.8lb console when schlepping it from one room to the next.",51,0.86,56,2020-09-29 03:37:43

Do you also think that playback quality will be improved on the Series X?

Geoff Keighley first impressions of the Series X,Xendor-,"""Spent this weekend hands-on with [@Xbox](https://twitter.com/Xbox)

Series X.   Impressions are limited to backwards compatible content and system-level features. We have not played next-gen games.  Thoughts:  - Quick Resume is a game changer! Love being able to instantly jump in exactly where I left off.

 Load times VASTLY improved across the board. I tested Fortnite, Warzone, Ori, Batman: Arkham Knight, even older titles like Modern Warfare 2 and Gears of War (the original 360 disc versions!)   Load Times + Quick Resume makes moving between games almost like Alt-TABing.

It's nice a new system works with previous gen content so seamlessly. (None of the games I played are specifically optimized for series X yet, I was playing/downloading the One X versions.)

Overall: Massive “quality of life” improvements to Xbox experience, everything (including UI) is super quick and responsive. System is quiet, super easy to setup.

One note: Quick Resume remembers your place in every game, so you can jump between games now.""

So I just read a post that explained just how fast the series X really is and it’s very impressive...RDR 2 apparently took 38 seconds to load fully on the internal SSD which is very nice given how big the game is 

And when it came to transferring games from an external HDD to the internal SSD, it took 7 minutes and 36 seconds to move AC:Origins from the HDD to the built in SSD

1. Can I download a game on Series S/X but not the actual optimised version, for example NBA 2K21, this game will have a Series S/X version but it also has a XB1X version. Can i use the non-optimised version on the newer consoles to preserve space on the SSD? Further can i switch between them or will they be entirely different files?
2. Do we have any idea on the file sizes for the enhanced games? I know COD:MW19 was larger than most games but there are plenty of very large games and that's without enhancement.

I'm just worried ill end up having to chose between games or not get games at all due to not having the space and not wanting to have to forever move games between an external HDD and the internal SSD of the console.

Switching to console after 8 years of pc gaming with GOD tier PCs,Additional_Piglet755,"Main reasons but not all of them are: 

Console simplicity is a thing of beauty. 
Xbox achievements really add a lot to games imo. 
I’m tired of having all these different platforms within windows to launch my games from. Currently using 5 different launchers... 
There’s practically zero HDR on pc games and when they do support it windows HDR doesn’t work at all. 
Cheaters on pc is real, and it’s annoying. Big time
Games on console are easier to dev for and MUCH more optimized. 1/5 or 1/4 times I buy a triple A game on pc, it will have serious or game breaking issues. 
Most pc exclusive games that are worth playing could be played on a laptop and don’t require any legit power... 

And finally the old argument that PC gaming is cheaper is honestly kinda dead. As a pc gamer I can tell you, it’s not cheaper unless you want a bellow average experience. 

The new Xbox series X can run games at 4k native, HDR, and 60fps. To build a pc that can run games like that you’d need to shell out at LEAST 1500 dollars. This is coming from a long time pc gamer here. 

Also, the SSD speeds on the new Xbox X are legitimately faster in games than ANY SSD money can buy for a PC. 

I could also write a novel on how frustrating windows is as a gaming platform.

Overall, I’m very excited to join the awesome Xbox community and start playing on Xbox X this November ! &lt;3",302,0.88,135,2020-09-28 16:43:22

"What is the ""most next gen game"" I should get or have for my Series X?",HankScorpio20,"Former PlayStation guy. Went all in on Xbox starting in April. Been buying lots of games I either had on PlayStation or newer games. Just games in general to have a nice collection ready for Series X. Have all my games ready in my 2TB so day one I just plug it in and transfer games to the SSD to take advantage of it. But now I'm thinking what is the most next gen game I can buy to blow my mind away on launch?

Day one PS4 owner and the game I just had to get was Killzone Shadow Fall. That looked next gen to me at the time. And even though I'm not a fan of the genre, Demon Souls to me is the most next gen game I've seen this time.

Now I keep throwing around ""most next gen game"". What i mean by that, what's the most visually impressive game available for when I get my Series X home? I can't do much about performance cuz I own a 60hz 4K HDR TV. So I can't even do 120hz. But what's the prettiest looking game is what it comes down to?

Looking forward to seeing any boosts to RDR 2, Halo MCC, Halo 5, Gears of War. Also hyped to see how next gen NBA 2K21 looks and how good COD will be. The most obvious one should be Cyberpunk but I'm apprehensive of calling it truly next gen cuz the game we buy will be the One X version. Which will no doubt he gorgeous but the upgrade isn't till next year and I'm sure THAT will be the most impressive looking game of 2021.",14,0.7,59,2020-09-28 12:22:07

I want him to have his own account so that we can seperate that.  Some questions though.

1. I'm guessing he'd have to re add all his friends and I can boot them off mine.  How would it work for games like Fortnite?  How can I transfer all that to his account?
2. To continue using the One S, I guess I set the X to Home(?) and S as an additional one?
3. Would I set up both of our accounts on each Xbox and then we can just sign in as needed?

Welcome to the Xbox family!

The next generation of consoles is coming, as are tons of questions.

This post provides guides and resources that cover the basics of the current state of Xbox. If you're new to Xbox, read **Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass** first.

Before you proceed, please check the [FAQ tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/faq) or [Info tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/information) from [r/XboxSeriesX](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX) for more information, guides, and helpful links.

# Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass

* **Xbox Live Gold (XBL) (US $9.99 monthly):** Allows online multiplayer. Free games every month through Games with Gold. [Click here to join Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live)
* **EA Play (US $4.99 monthly):** Library of older games published by EA. New games are added 6-9 months after release.
* **Game Pass for PC/Game Pass for Console) (US $9.99 monthly):** Game subscription service providing access to over 200+ Microsoft and third-party games. First-party MS games stay forever while third-party titles are timed. Game Pass for PC includes EA Play starting in December for PC(Game Pass for console does **NOT** include EA play!). Xbox Live Gold (not included) is not required for Game Pass games unless it's Online multiplayer.
* **xCloud** \- Cloud game streaming service for mobile access to select Game Pass titles. Still in Beta and not available as a standalone product.
* **Game Pass Ultimate (GPU) (US $14.99 monthly):** Includes Xbox Live Gold, EA Play (November 10th for Console), Game Pass for PC, Game Pass for Console, and xCloud in one package.

## Game Pass Ultimate And XBL Conversion For $1
*(This is an extremely good deal for gamers new to Xbox, existing gamers, and parents..)*

Microsoft has been running a promotion where you get the first month of Game Pass Ultimate for $1 (USD).  But its actually much better than that.

In the *Terms and Conditions* of the promotion, it states that it will convert all Xbox Live Gold and/or Game Pass time to Game Pass Ultimate time at a 1:1 ratio for $1 (depending on eligibility it could be $14.99).  The maximum time that can be converted is 36 months. The estimated savings for the full 36 months, if you buy XBL at retail price, is $359 (USD) saved.

* When will this promotion end? **No date confirmed**
* Can I do this if I have before? **Yes**
* Can I do this if I currently have a GPU subscription active? **No, adding XBL to your account converts at a 3/1 ratio**
* Can I do this if I currently have a Game Pass for PC or Console subscription active? **Yes**
* Can I do this without an Xbox? **Yes**
* Can I buy XBL from a different region where it's cheaper? **Yes, but you must use a VPN and you may experience region issues with the code redemptions**
* Can I do this if I am no longer eligible for the $1 promotion price? **Yes, but you must make a one-time US $14.99 payment instead of $1**

**Note:** If the total time (XBL + Game Pass time) in your account is more than 36 months, use a PC to activate the promotion. Any time over the 36 month maximum will **disappear**. *Update:* Receiving mixed reports on this so it's best to try to not exceed 36 months.

### Instructions

1. On your [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/services), turn off any existing recurring billing for Game Pass or XBL.
2. Purchase three 12-month Xbox Live Gold cards for your region from a retailer like Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, CDKeys, or others. **Note:** CDKeys is a ""gray market"" site that sells these cards at steep discounts. They're easy to use and reliable.
3. Visit [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com/) and redeem each XBL key. For each key, turn off the recurring billing toggle before you click **Submit**.
4. Check that you have at least 36 months of time on your account (XBL time + Game Pass time).
5. Visit the [Xbox Game Pass page](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) for your region, select your region at the bottom left (only for non US residents), and click **Join Now**.
6. Click **Join for $1** under *Ultimate*.
7. Follow the prompts and provide your payment information when asked.

You should see that all your Game Pass and XBL time now says *upgraded to Game Pass Ultimate* in your Microsoft account.

**Cost Breakdown:** *36 months of GPU at retail price would normally be $540 ($14.99 x 36 months) but with this promotion you can get it for $181 (36 months of XBL for $180 + $1 promotion (or $15 depending on eligibility)*

# Backwards Compatibility

The new Xbox consoles support all Xbox One titles as well as any Xbox/Xbox 360 titles that are already supported on Xbox One.  
You may experience improvements to load times, framerate, and resolution.

Kinect and headsets with optical sound connectors are not currently supported.

# Expanding Storage

The new Xbox consoles have a storage expansion slot. Currently the only supported storage for this slot is the [Seagate Expansion Card](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-1tb-expansion-card). You can install games here and play them directly from the card.

While pricey, cheaper third-party alternatives are inevitable down the road.

You can also use an external HDD or SSD (via the USB 3.1 [gen 1] ports) to store Series X or S games that you aren't playing. You can't play these directly from the drives and need to transfer them back to supported storage (shown on [IGN's Hands On video](https://youtu.be/OdgMB81d_yc)** 3:18 minute mark**)

You can use an external drive to play non-enhanced backwards-compatible games from the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox.

For a quick reference, see [this diagram](https://i.imgur.com/AwGKbwu.jpg) (courtesy [u/beateride](https://www.reddit.com/u/beateride)) and [Xbox Expansion Explained](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/24/xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s-custom-storage-solution-primer/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) for more detailed information.

# Xbox All Access

[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access)

Xbox All Access is a monthly payment option which gives you a console and two years of GPU. The Xbox Series S is $24.99 a month and the Xbox Series X is $34.99, in the U.S.

All Access involves opening a line of credit with a local credit issuer through the Microsoft-authorized service provider in your area. This means a credit check that usually impacts your credit score.

To see if All Access is available in your region, see the [supported regions list](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/09/xbox-all-access-expands-to-12-countries-this-holiday/).

# Bethesda Acquistion

There is no confirmation on if Xbox will make Bethesda games exclusive. Phil Spencer said it will be on a ""case-by-case basis"" for console exclusivity.

All Bethesda games are set to be added and launched on Game Pass.

"XBOX IP shuffle! Now that Xbox owns all of this great IP and all these great studios, which studio should make which IP?",jmottss,"EDIT 1: This is purely a hypothetical question. I do not expect MS to start swapping IPs between studios. Just thought it’d be interesting to imagine what some of these studios could do with different IP.  Please don’t take this too seriously. 

What do y’all think would be a cool match up of Xbox owned IP and studio? Here’s what I got:

Ninja theory: DOOM

I think Ninja theory could do some crazy stuff with the DOOM IP. Obviously don’t call it DOOM and don’t make it an FPS. 

Double Fine: Viva Piñata or Banjo

Playground: MS Flight Sim “horizon”

Basically the same thing they did for Forza but for flight sim. Give us an arcade open world version of MS flight sim with the “sim” portion toned way down and more fun shit to do. 

The Coalition: Trenched

MOJANG: Halo

Not a mainline Halo entry, just some cool side story spin off craziness. I could even just see Minecraft, but set on a Halo ring.

Why does there seem to be this aura of “Microsoft can’t make future Bethesda games exclusive! How dare they!”?,January1st2020AD,"I don’t get it. All the people complaining about Microsoft having “no games” so Microsoft remedies the situation by creating or buying studios with the express purpose of creating exclusive games yet I feel like there’s still this whole undercurrent of “Nooo!

Are JRPG (and jap. games in general) fans just a vocal minority?,mangabernd,"We had many exclusive shmups and JRPG on the 360 and nothing on the One. Now the standard narrative is ""They don't sell on Xbox"" but is that really the case?

Nier Automata did really good and BandaiNamco and SquareEnix release all the big titles, Kemco ports all the mobile SNES-style JRPG and we finally got Yakuza, Kingdom Hearts and will get Dragon Quest 11.

Are fans of japanese games just a vocal minority? Every comment section of a new trailer, game reveal or news article is filled with comments of fans who want those games. Genshin Impact releases tomorrow on EVERY platform - except Xbox. Same with Ryza 2 later this year. Wonderful101 remake was announced for Xbox and removed later during the Kickstarter.

Atlus was surprised how good Persona sold on Steam and they want to port more. They still skip Xbox even though Sega sees how well their games do on Gamepass. I'm fine with digital only releases because the print runs are apparently way too big for those niche titles.

Let's talk about the other studios a part of the Bethesda deal,watchmensmile77,"If you are an Xbox fan is been a rollercoaster high week with the acquisition of Bethesda/Zenimax. It has been at this point discussed extensively what the acquisition means debated whether the games will go to other consoles and what the big studios will offer. For Bethesda Softworks, ID Software, Zenimax Online, and to some extent Machine Games and Arkane. We know the IP's: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield, Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored, Evil Within, Quake, and Ghost Wire. 

We know that Arkane is doing Deathloop and working on new IP your guess is as good as mine as to what that is whether they continue Dishonored or do something else. Machine Games could work on new IP after putting out 3 or 4 Wolfenstein games or continue with spin-offs. Tango is locked on Ghostwire and Evil Within. The interesting conversation is Alpha Dog and Roundhouse.

Both are studios that are actually under Bethesda and not independent studios under Zenimax. One is a studio concentrated on mobile games and the other is Human Head re-branded. These are more like support AA studios. There are 3 options for the direction of these studios they stay the same, they stay the same and become support studios, or they grow and shift direction and become studios that do new IP or work on existing Bethesda IP in new ways or Microsoft IP.

   So what am I getting at you have Blades and Fallout Shelter plus current games that are on mobile for Alpha Dog to help Bethesda with and their games. Those are games with tens or hundreds of million players that can go to X Cloud as Shelter is already on Xbox and we may see a new version of that. There is also a huge opportunity for these studios to expand and certain IP that can our huge opportunities to continue on Xbox and now have the manpower and dev assets to plan that out. I am talking of Mech Assault as part of the Battletech Series and Killer Instinct. Mech Assault could be a great direction for Machine Games if they take a break from Wolfenstein but you can get several studios working on a project like that and provide a mech game with an awesome engine and shooting mechanics and invest in the lore and be narrative-driven. Killer Instinct with Roundhouse or help remasters or remake Ryse Son of Rome with Crytek. This is speculation and what I might like to see that can be done. What are yours? What do you think should or will be done with these lesser-known studios or even possibly studios at a crossroads and not as monetarily successful as Bethesda and ID but that can be invested in and have massive potentials like Arkane, Tango, and Machine.

Slipspace Engine rumored 500 million development cost makes sense with Zenimax acquisition,SagitariiusA,"The rumor that halo infinite development so far cost 500 million and that most time was spent on the slipspace engine may actually make sense with this acquisition. If MS planned to acquire Zenimax for years, developing a new engine for titles that long have used out dated engines such as Fallout, would totally make sense, it enables those future zenimax games that need a new engine to immediately have one available to them, and not need 3-5 years for engine development plus 3-5 years for game development. Could a future fallout game, or Elder scrolls, be built on the slipspace engine?

I only ask, because I don't want to, say, buy it on the Xbox One, and it only be playable on the Xbox One. Or similarly, I don't want to go to buy it on the Series X, and it by the Series X version that doesn't release for another year or two.

If true I also think it's the opposite of what Game Pass really achieves. Worries free I can hop into all these different first and third party games. I know most third party games leave Game Pass eventually. This don't worries me because If I played the game and I liked it I just buy the game.

Now is the time for Xbox to hit hard and go full steam. Amazon Luna is on paper a huge threat,Viperaaspis,"Amazon Luna has huge international coverage. The Twitch integration is an advantage. Twitch is the number one streaming platform and Twitch streamers will promote Amazon Luna. Amazon is a trillion dollar company and its AWS has twice the servers market share as Microsoft's Azure. 

Their Ubisoft deal is a plus too. They call it Ubisoft channel with their new games available on day one. This implies that their will be other channels. 

Speculation: What if PlayStation makes a deal with Amazon? PSnow is already a streaming service, combined with Amazon Luna offer, it can become a stiff competitor to xCloud. 

Amazon Luna has just been announced. We still haven't seen it in action yet. Therefore, if Xbox keeps building on its momentum, keeps pushing games out and if, this is something their are lacking doing, they start to do more TV commercials and all sorts of adverts, then a comfortable advance can be built.

I am quite confident that when DF will post their Xbox Series X video, it will boost the sales even further up. 

I don't know if this post will be pushed away as being uninteresting, or too speculative. 

If not:

Do you foresee an Amazon Playstion deal?

What do you think Xbox should do to improve its market share?

Are you confident in xCloud's long lasting future?

Xbox advantage over Luna, is their Studios, can you think about something else and share it?

The difference between this launch and previous ones,MoistMorsel1,"Do you remember the xbox one launch?  Aside from the kinnect only games, there weren't that many that could not be played on the xbox 360.  Forza, assassins creed Black flag, call of doodie ghosts, lego marvel superheroes.  I think, of all of these games, the only ones that were next gen only were dead rising 3 and ryse, and I wonder if these games **really** couldnt have played on the xbox 360 too.

This gen there is alot of focus on **true** next gen titles.  With Xbox setting the way and saying everything will be playable on XB1 the initial reaction was ""XB1 will hold games back"" but, now that Sony have decided to cash in too, this is no longer a problem.  Curious huh!  But anyways, I digress.

I've been looking at the titles and this time the only next gen title is the medium, which is fine.  But I wonder why it is such an issue for so many people.

In reality every game over the next couple of years will have had some sort of development on the XB1 (Or in GTAVs case, the XB 360).  Which means the majority of games could have worked on the XB1.  So why shouldn't they?

I appreciate some people want that next generation feel but here I am thinking all of these games will look better on the next gen consoles and, if you haven't played a game, what's the problem with a next gen update?  They could just have held off the release of these games and pegged them as a ""next gen only"" launch titles, but what is the point if it *could* be made to play on multiple generations?

Then I look at titles like gears 5 ultimate, being updated for next gen.  Ironic that if it were not released last year, and the back compat was removed, people wouldn't be questioning if it were next gen or not.  Personally...I haven't played a load of the games that are being ""enhanced"" for next gen yet due to time, and I cant imagine I'm the only one.  So does that make them ""next gen""?

I guess I'm just poking at the thought that, it doesnt really matter where a game was released first (bright memory for example).  If the game is good then we have plenty to be excited about.  A shit game will always be a shit game - even if it maxes out an RTX 3090 and other top of the range hardware.

And, as a disclaimer, im not buying either console at launch.  I'll prolly get one in 2 years when I've paid off some covid related debts.  This is really just a discussion piece and I'd urge people to remember that there are going to be a wide range of disagreements here that we should all respect.",0,0.44,25,2020-09-27 16:09:42
The Actual Reason X1SX Enhanced Requires the NVME SSD?,darkonex,"So I've just been thinking and I can't really grasp the reason why XBox One Series X enhanced games have to be run from the NVME.

So what exactly makes the X1SX so special that it absolutely requires them to be run from the internal or the addon NVME?  Also don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on XB at all, I absolutely love Xbox and I have the Series X preordered along with the PS5 and I'm more excited about the Series X so this isn't a hate thing.

Hopefully MS acquisition of Bethesda will be a chance to produce quality RPGs that are more similar to old titles than recent ones.,Dorjcal,"I really hope that the acquisition brings new ideas and creativity to the RPG division because I always felt that the quality of the games got worse and worse with each title. 
Beside the micro transaction stuff, I always felt that they kept dumbing down their game to cater to larger audiences. Now with gamepass that problem is over so I really wish they looked at the past rather than the recent games.

Morrowind is by far better than Oblivion, which in turn is better than Skyrim. Of course Skyrim has the prettier graphics, but nothing can beat the sense of immersion and customization that I had with Morrowind. 

Obviously we don’t even have to talk about Falliut 76.., but I always felt that Fallout 3 experience was superior to Fallout 4.

Probably this is an unpopular opinion, but I wanted to know if there is anyone out there that shares my thoughts.

XSX or upgrading my PC,ser6651,"So I currently have a ryzen 2600 with rx 580. I am in a weird spot regarding what path to take. Please discuss

Points favouring upgrading PC:
1.Planning upgrade to a 3060 or AMD equivalent means i will probably have a better GPU than XSX.
2. I already have majority of friends that play on PC not on consoles
3. I already have atleast 150usd worth of games on PC which means i have a small library that I can't bring with me to XSX

Points against upgrading
1. I might only be able to afford a 1080p 144hz monitor which I do not want. 
2. I will have to change my PSU aswell (It's a MasterWatt Lite don't laugh 😭) which adds further cost.
3. I would prefer a 4k TV like TCL P8 because I could watch Netflix and other 4k content on it while being able to play XSX
4. XSX is more portable than lugging around a cpu case
5. Now the most important point. I am entering the phase of my life where I do not think I will have enough time to do upgrades and the usual PC troubleshooting (Even though I am tech savvy enough to do it) I will be an actual registered doctor in 3 months and the 32 hour shifts that come with it are no joke. I would want just a plug and play device which doesn't give me a hassle after a long day at work.

Some notes on why the Bethesda acquisition happened and what it means for TES/FO and Xbox going forward,bjj_starter,"ZeniMax/Bethesda were struggling financially a lot before Microsoft acquired them, that's why the owners were trying to sell the company. It's why Bethesda made Elder Scrolls Online and FO76, why they leaned so hard into microtransactions, and they still weren't financially stable. They needed to be acquired to keep the company's finances solvent and be able to continue making games, Microsoft had the money to support them to continue making great games. Be glad that Microsoft bought it, because the bidder they won against was fucking EA, and EA would have absolutely gutted Bethesda Game Studios and everything else under ZeniMax.

Read more about Bethesda's fragility and the potential for an EA acquisition here if you're interested: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/from-banking-scandal-to-video-game-ceo-to-billion-dollar-score

And more about the volatile nature of the industry leading to Bethesda's troubles here: https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/22/xboxs-bethesda-acquisition-is-evidence-of-blockbuster-gamings-volatility/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


Here's an examination of how games acquisitions have gone in the past, noting that EA is five of these examples and they have consistently completely fucked over acquisitions, so it's fantastic that they didn't get Bethesda/ZeniMax: https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-12-of-gamings-biggest-studios-after-they-were-sold/

And if you're worried because of the two terrible Microsoft examples in that documentary (Ensemble and Lionhead), here's a fantastic documentary on the development of Halo Wars that tells the full story of why Ensemble shut and it's a lot more complicated than just ""Microsoft closed Ensemble"": https://youtu.be/igaB219Ic8c

As for Lionhead, what ruined them was the Kinect bullshit Microsoft was pulling at the start of the Xbox One generation, with Don Mattrick forcing them into making Kinect games. Absolutely, insanely, terrible decision making. Out of touch with Xbox employees and customers and leading to the worst generation launch of Xbox ever. Microsoft removed Don Mattrick and replaced him with Phil Spencer, who ended the Kinect bullshit and has dramatically improved Xbox. Don Mattrick literally did not care about Xbox (https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1102441475898404864?s=19) and Phil Spencer understands exactly what went wrong with the launch and is committed to not repeating those mistakes (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/). I also find it interesting that if you go back and rewatch that terrible launch, the first time anyone talks about games is 30 minutes in when Phil Spencer shows up to introduce some EA game.

I get why people are worried, and I don't like the industry consolidating or the practice of exclusives either. But Bethesda Game Studios are by far my favourite studios, they were going under without a buyer, and Microsoft outbid EA. EA would have unceremoniously killed TES and Fallout by taking all of the recent Bethesda microtransaction/games as a service shit and turning it up to 11 for every game. At least as Microsoft exclusives, they can make high quality single player games, and the only requirement on the games is that they be desirable enough to drive console sales, aka the games just need to be good, not super profitable, much like God of War.",228,0.94,93,2020-09-27 13:17:22
Placing the SX on top of a subwoofer?,FinalOdyssey,"My setup is a bit limited. I am buying a new TCL 2020 6 Series  soon and I don't expect my current TV stand mount to have the correct VESA hookups for the tv, it's a very old stand from 2008. If it doesn't fit on the mount, I'll have to put the TV directly on the top shelf which isn't a huge deal but I was going to put my SX there. I have other places I can put the SX, but I was wondering if placing it on top of a subwoofer is ok? I am worried that the bass from the woofer might somehow slowly wiggle something loose in the console. I currently have my switch on top of it and it's been fine for a year, but I'm more worried about the SX because it's a more in-depth, complex system. Any opinions?

Is placing items on a subwoofer generally a bad idea? For those interested I have the Samsung K450 soundbar+sub. There is definitely enough room on top of the sub for the SX.",0,0.47,27,2020-09-27 12:43:31

THE INITIATIVE: What do you think the game it's about? 🤔,AnglzSpace,,114,0.9,70,2020-09-27 09:27:24
The next Xbox Games Showcase,tim_timmayy,"This has in my opinion been the overall greatest month in Xbox history. The Series S reveal, price and release reveal, preorders selling out in multiple countries, the success of XCloud, Bethesda acquisition, and now sending units to media outlets for gameplay. 

Xbox has a lot of good momentum right now, and they need to keep their foot on the gas pedal until launch. October would be great month for another games showcase. 

Matt Booty said that we haven’t heard from all studios. From the July Showcase we’ve haven’t seen what’s going on with The Coalition, Mojang, Worlds Edge, InExile, Compulsion, and The Initiative. Plus the newly acquired Bethesda studios. 

I also see this as an opportunity to provide insight on the games from studios we’ve not seen, updates on previously announced titles, as well as GamePass promotions. 

Hypothetically speaking I could see The Initiatives Game be the opener. It’s in a playable state, at this point i feel we should at least get a reveal trailer. 

And then towards the end they pass it to their Bethesda Studios. Todd Howard shows Wolfenstein 3, ESO expansion, Doom DLC, shadow drops all Bethesda titles on GP, and then they “and one more thing” and it is Starfield with an April 2021 release date.

Xbox has done a complete 180 since the whole Halo Infinite fiasco.,LoganH1219,"When the gameplay event happened back in July, Xbox didn’t seem like it was in the best place and I think we can all agree with that. No major 1st party launch titles except for Halo Infinite and that game looked very unfinished. No forza, no gears, nothing. It got to the point where, after the Halo Infinite delay, I even considered not preordering the Series X and just waiting a year or so.

But wow they turned it around big time. Phil Spencer style. 

Announcement after announcement. Reveal after reveal. Amazing PR lately. They released MFS, announced game streaming was going public with GPU, announced the very affordable Series S, Xbox all access, game pass additions, Game Pass X EA Play, and who could forget, the purchase of Bethesda!

I’m sure I’m forgetting some other stuff too but they have really made a complete turn around from where they were 2-3 months ago. And they’ve been killing it on social media lately too. I’m honestly so impressed and it makes me happy to see Xbox finally getting the PR it deserves for all its pro-consumer practices such as being able to use your controllers and accessories day one on Xbox Series X|S. 

Can’t wait to see you all on November 10th!",305,0.88,121,2020-09-26 22:05:01
"Very excited for launch! A couple of questions, please",linkx13,"1. I'm not very excited about Xbox's launch games except for Cyberpunk, but I think I'm going to wait for the upgrade. That said, I haven't owned an Xbox in years so I'm fine playing through older games that are awesome. I think the best bet to do this is just get Gamepass, right? Or is there a game I should consider that won't be on Gamepass?

2. I understand that I should buy a few years (up to three) of Xbox gold and upgrade to Gamepass for $1 because it's a great deal, but this is sort of a loophole. The only wrinkle is that I don't actually have an Xbox yet and won't be able to upgrade immediately, so if I buy three years of gold and they change the upgrade so that it's not $1, isn't it possible I could get screwed?",3,0.71,16,2020-09-26 21:54:52

How Does Game Pass Work with Family Sharing,GleamingGlider,"So I just maxed out my live account to sign up for game pass for the first time in anticipation of getting my series X and was wondering if there is any family sharing options. My wife, son, and I all have Xbox accounts and are connected together as a family, he’s only 7. 

My question is can I share access to games on their accounts so we can game on different devices or can they all just be signed into my account. For example if my wife is playing ori on her gaming pc, I’m playing halo on the series x, and my son is playing untitled goose game on the Xbox one, can we all be doing this simultaneously? I’m just curious since we can do something similar with sharing on steam.

Thanks, I’m so excited to for Xbox this next gen and want to make sure my entire family can enjoy.",3,0.72,9,2020-09-26 19:10:12

"One account, multiple consoles",smidgeons,"Hey,

If I own a Series S and a Series X, am I able to log into both with one account?

I searched around online and found info about game sharing etc (for people who have kids and share games to their account/machine).  But I don't want to do that, just me, one account at the same address so the same wifi network/ip etc. I'm not account sharing or anything weird.

Just trying to figure out if I can, say log into my series S in the bedroom and access everything I own from there. (or at least things the S can access, such as the digital games i own).

I assume though, if say someone was watching Netflix downstairs the system would log them out if I logged into the series S upstairs.  Not a big issue as I doubt i'd ever need both consoles logged in at the same time anyway, but just struggled to find much info for people who want multiple machines but not for sharing games with other users/accounts.

Think i've just been spoiled by Netflix in that I can watch part of an episode on my PC and then continue watching from where I left off on my TV etc.  I just really like that freedom, so it would be nice for my console to do the same.

Again, not a huge issue. But I was just curious but struggled to find info that wasn't all about  parents/kids to share games.  I just want to be able to log into whatever console I want and access my full account.

I'm pretty sure i will be able to but just wasn't quite sure what dodgy restrictions they might have in place.  Nintendo, for example, are massively annoying in that consoles are tied to accounts for the most part.

Thanks :)",11,0.79,13,2020-09-26 16:36:12
Do we know wether Xcloud will support gyro aiming?,Loldimorti,"So one of the big reasons why I planned on getting a PS5 before getting an Xbox is that the Dualsense has a motion sensor that allows for gyro aiming in shooters.

It's something I've grown very accustomed to when playing on Nintendo Switch and at this point I don't think I can go back to standard stick aiming and having to rely on aim assist.

But now it seems like a lot of shooters like Doom, Wolfenstein and Prey are becoming Xbox first party titles. Unfortunately even the new Xbox controller still seems to not have any motion sensors. But I just remembered that you will be able to play Xbox games on your phone via Xcloud. Gyro aiming is also quite popular on phones and frankly I have no idea how you would even play a shooter on your phone without gyro.

So does that mean that you can use a controller that supports gyro and use it to play Xbox games via xcloud on your phone?

Could you possibly connect that controller to your Xbox and get the same gyro functionality when playing directly on your console?",0,0.5,4,2020-09-26 16:12:25

I am about to cancel my pre-order of an Xbox Series S,ApeGeek,"For the first time in my life, I took the decision to pre-order a console, without knowing if it was the right decision. As a broken student, budget is quite short and the Series S appeared as the best pick for me. No 4K TV at home, just a regular cheap Full HD / 60 HZ monitor (plus the fact that I am living abroad for the year so I don't have any monitor in my flat share -&gt; planning on playing games through console streaming) 

Yet, days are passing and the more I think of it, the more it sounds like an impulsive decision, made because of a lack of money. I already have an Xbox One SAD. And while Game Pass is a fantastic feature, even more nowadays, I can't ignore muddy graphics, poor framerate and technical limitations. Deep down, I want to experience true next-gen, I want to see what technology can offer at its best, I want to be amazed and captivated. 

£250 is quite an amount for me so I have to make the right decision. Should I maintain my pre-order, sticking at good ol' 1080p for a decent price ? Or is 4K gaming a genuine game changer that justify such a huge investment in a Series X ?",0,0.43,46,2020-09-26 15:03:25

New to console: can I play with another player using the same console?,ama78921,"Hi guys,

This is my first time buying a console. I fulfilled my 18 year dream of buying a console! Super thrilled, but not sure how I can play multiplayer at home with my wife.

We have two largish monitors in two other rooms for work.

How can we play multiplayer with each other, either using the XSX only or perhaps XSX vs PS5?

I don't know how this works. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Edit: can we play multiplayer using either XSX or PS5 or both on the same TV, somehow?

Who Here Is Getting The Series X A Year Or Six Months Later From Launch?,MaximilienH,"IMO, I feel that the Series X is a console with great value and the recent MS acquisition of Bethesda has made me desire the Series X a lot more. However, I won't be getting it at launch and instead around the holidays next year. I feel that the main big reason is that the Series X is seeming like a console that will start to gain value later on in the console generation. Although upcoming games like Avowed, Hellblade 2, and the Bethesda acquisition (with the prospect of future Bethesda titles like Starfield and Fallout 5 being exclusive) has made me want the Series X, most of these games are probably coming out Q4 2021 at the earliest and the effects of the Bethesda acquisition will probably not be so relevant in the first two years of the generation. Because of this, the Series X **at launch** does not seem very appealing, but I think that it will possibly become the best value console when the main Xbox exclusives really start showing up midway in the generation. Although Gamepass undoubtedly has great value, it isn't appealing to me since I'm the sort of person who likes having games physically and also since I already own most games on Gamepass that appeal to me now. As of now, the Series X launch lineup looks less appealing than the PS5 one which has games that appeal to me like Spider-man and Demon's Souls (so I'll be getting the PS5 first since it offers better value to me now), but the Series X (with all the new studios and IP's Xbox has acquired, plus Phil Spencer at the helm) seems to be shaping up as the sleeping giant of the next-gen console generation thats poised to bring the best value and most likely some of the best games. I would like to know your thoughts and opinions on this (and if anyone is of similar opinion), and I'm excited to join you all on Xbox later next year.",0,0.41,31,2020-09-26 06:12:07

"Are there any versions of games that will only have the xb1 version? As in, no smart delivery?",go_go_gadget88,"After talking with my wife, we have decided that the XB approach to cross-gen games seems better in the sense there is only 1 disc to buy for the xb1's and the series. So we are going to use our XBSX for all the cross gen stuff, and the ps5 for the sony exclusives and online stuff.

My question is, are they ALL like this for now? Or are some going to be just xb1 versions and others will be only for series games? 

I ask because I'm looking into preordering AC Valhalla as something to play on the XB when it launches. Most places like gamestop, bby, target, etc, all seem to show a cover with the smart delivery logo on them, and say Xbox 1 / Xbox Series, leading me to think I could just get that 1 disk, and it would play at varying levels depending on if it was in the xb1, xb1x, or the series x.  However, walmart appears to be selling it for $10 less than the others, but the picture for that one looks like it is ONLY an xbox one game? So would that version not have any series x enhancement? Or is it just a situation where they have the wrong picture, and that's the same game everyone else is selling?

I purchased a seagate 8tb expansion for my Xbox one a while back and I'm curious if I'll be able to unplug it and use it for an Xbox Series X.  I've searched it up on Google, and the answer there was Yes, but I have a couple other questions.

On the Google answer it said ""you'll be able to remove it and take it to someone else's house to use on their Xbox Series X or S"", but will the games on it be playable on the Series X or Seies S?

I'm sorry if the answer is fairly obvious, I'm just not tech savvy.

Has anyone else had the same problem and if so does anyone know exactly what it means? Klarna doesnt even seem to know themselves and keep saying its to do with Game due to no preorders left but i have a preorder secured.

XSX with PC,pmo2408,"Will games optimized for XSX run better than a “high end” PC?

Towards the end of last generation, with the release of Destiny 2 on PC, I decided to build my own rig, 1080ti 8700k, runs games great with high frame rates (120 FPS at 1440p) and a high FOV.

I have been an Xbox gamer since the dawn of halo, but now I am questioning this upcoming generation. I have an X1X in home and have a XSX preordered currently.

Everyone says I don’t need an Xbox because everything I can get on PC. Problem is, Gamepass ultimate divides games between PC and console (like Doom Eternal coming up or how Red Dead Redemption 2 was only on Xbox Gamepass). They also enhance certain games for the X1X and will do so for XSX.

So should I keep the XSX preorder and sell my X1X? Sell both? Just want another perspective on maximizing value here going forward.

PC - 1080ti
X1X console
NX console

Xbox Series X/S Post Pre-order Megathread,BatMatt93,"Hey r/XboxSeriesX

It's been a crazy 48 hours since the Xbox Series X and S went on sale. Many victorious stories of people spamming the F5 key fast enough to get through and unfortunately sad stories of others being beaten by the dreaded web page error demon. Whichever way you look at it, emotions were all over the place.

We have been noticing a lot of posts coming up of people celebrating their pre-orders, noticing their pre-orders being cancelled, and others noticing some sites still having stock and wanting to share. So we figured it would be best to have a megathread for everyone to share all this information in one place. So any of these posts made outside of the megathread will be removed, it all must be put in here.

We would love to try and update this posts with links to sites, but with how quick they sell out we just wouldn't be fast enough so we'll be keeping the sorting by new as the default so people will hopefully be able to catch those type of posts. For those having their pre-orders cancelled, be sure to share it here and any solutions that you might have to help others so that they don't fall victim to it too if its possible to avoid happening. If the solutions are verified to work, I will update this megathread showing the solutions.

As always, if you guys have any suggestions on something to add to this megathread be sure to let us know in modmail.

Xbox how do you incentivize and put pressure on individual game developer studios to be better then everyone else under game pass? Where is the capitalist approach to win a market for a individual game when no one is buying a game directly with game pass?,OpticBlitz,"Assuming Gamepass becomes what a majority of Xbox users subscribe to, what puts pressure on a developer if a majority of their customers will be playing the game through game pass. A capitalist approach would be to compete with other game developers to win the customer but now if no one is paying directly for a game under game pass what drives or incentivizes a game developer to be better than everyone else? 

Also under a game pass type of ecosystem would that encourage game developers to utilize micro transactions because people won’t be buying the game directly?

My favorite game developer is Bethesda game studios. I would hate to see that studio become relaxed by not having to compete with say obsidian over customers dropping $60. Since no one is directly buying their game with game pass I fear it could decrease pressure to be better or more innovative than other rpg game developers. I just hope that Bethesda game studios will continue to push themselves and make amazing content better then the competition and not fall in the mindset of having a safety net “gamepass” incase they fail or don’t exceed expectation.",0,0.21,26,2020-09-25 08:26:16
Series X pre ordered. Keeping One X as secondary gaming console vs xCloud on phone.,HankScorpio20,"Already posted a similar post on here but would wanna gather more thoughts on this. So I was a PlayStation guy pretty much all generation. Got a One X in April in case I couldn't get a Series X and to make the move to Xbox already. Loved it and my PS4 Pro went unused for months. I always had the idea of selling my One X for the Series X but now I'm attached to it cuz it's amazing and it could still be handy for a few years. I'd use it on my 1080p tv in my bedroom and the Series X in the living room on the 4K.

The thing tempting me to trade it is that I'd pay around $30 for my Series X. I have a second kid due in April and I'd wanna save as much as I could for that. Without trading the One X, I'd pay $240 ish out of pocket for the console, controller, warranty and battery pack since I'm trading more things. So it could obviously save me money so kinda obvious what I should do.

BUT I wanna keep it for occasions I wanna be in the room when company is over. I could free up the living room and they could chill there instead of being in the kitchen all the time and I could be in the room left alone. Also like I said with a second kid on the way, I could use the One X for occasions I can't come to the living room and have to be in the room to help out. Baby can fall asleep and I'll play quietly for a bit. Also I would like to be in bed with my girls on lazy days and play.

The thing making me double think a console in the room is that I know when I can play, I'll wanna play on the big 4K. I've had consoles in the room before and I don't use them that much.

So with that being said, would I just be better off using an Xbox One controller and using xCloud for the occasional gaming in the room or should I just keep a console that was made for gaming and not streaming?",1,0.57,8,2020-09-25 08:25:30

Question about storage on Xbox series X,Rpgfan10,So I know with the series x you have to have a game installed in the internal drive (or expansion drive if your rich) to take advantage  of any enhancements but what about an Xbox one x enhanced game I have installed on a normal USB drive. Will it still be enhanced on the series x or require it to be installed in the internal drive? Also I have a SSD drive I use on my one x is wondering if the series x will perform better with it than the one x? Eb say load times for red dead 2 is 15 secs on the one x would the series x have similar load times using the external ssd?,0,0.25,6,2020-09-25 08:08:36

"Xbox Series - S - It would be a great 1440p console, but...",Turbulent_Visual7764,"If you're sold on the idea of 1440p gaming? I wouldn't get too excited.

Xbox One - X has demonstrated that the level of 1440p support we receive, on the Xbox, is only as far as 1440p native display support.  The  majority of games, if any, DO NOT support / output 1440p. This has been a problem for 3 years now. Developers seldom choose to support 1440p...this is odd because the Xbox One - X  has a great and capable 1440p GPU and NEVER should have been forced into 4K.

Case-in-point? Consoles have always had this problem. With vendors refusing to believe that a LARGE part of the community runs standard PC monitors to game off of...and not necessarily 40-72 inch TVs (try easily getting one of these into a dorm)  with standardized timings and only a handful of resolutions (480, 720, 1080 and 4K resolution). So while you can definitely go into the Xbox settings and set your display to 1440p? Your games will still be forced to upscale 1080p to your 1440p display, which looks hella ugly, or VSR/ downsample 4K output onto 1440p, which does look nice. As far as native 1440p?

How can we transfer all our games to both consoles for free or will only one console get all the games? (Extra info: we play on 2 different accounts and my account is the home Xbox)

In a few years I think VR may be the only thing that saves console gaming.,muhname,"* Amazon Luna $30 Firestick, PC/Mac, Phone
* Google Stadia $30 Chromecast, PC/Mac, Mobile 
* Microsoft Xcloud 
* Nvidia GeForce Now
* Sony PSNow
* Apple Game Service

I get the objections to latency issues, library issues, etc. Here's why I don't think these will stop the sea change that is about to happen. 

The  biggest server companies in the world are now competing to deliver games as a service on streaming devices that encompass mobile, computer, smart TVs and dirt cheap streaming TV devices. They work with controllers from any game system and they cost $6-$15 a month. These services will be available to the masses. Amazon will promote on Twitch, FireTV. Google will promote on YouTube and Google TV devices. Apple will promote on Apple TV and iOS devices. 

The competition to improve the quality of these services over the next few years is going to be intense. 4K 120 will be possible and you will even see a teraflops race on the server side. Microsoft Xcloud is already one-upping Google's Stadia teraflops next year. 

I know it seems like this tech is far away still from console quality, but a competition has just started between the biggest tech/cloud companies in the world. The console wars of this generation will be a sidebar of the game streaming wars. This could be the last generation of consoles. 

The only hardware they sell that will matter will be the streaming stick and the controller. 

Beyond that what devices will require additional hardware? VR? Motion controllers? Cameras? 

These are things you can't easily slot into a streaming stick or mobile device.",0,0.29,51,2020-09-25 04:37:20

Indie games needs a bit more recognition,Gamermclord,"No rant no complaints. Just a bit of discussion.
So as a pc gamer with not so amazing specs (6th gen i7 Gtx1060) I fell in love with indie games. Not only are they cheap but I didn't need to care about graphics and frame rate issues. And so many choices. No loot boxes, DLCs, constant patches etc.. All in all indie games are amazing. Plus it's fascinating how many amazing games a small team or an individual can make. 

I am very pleased that xbox has something called ID@xbox and is supporting indie but still most of the indie games I see not many of them.. There are so many games like project Winter. Among trees and of course among us that must come to xbox.

I just wanna discuss the future of xbox towards indie games. Can we expect to see more freedom like steam? And I feel Microsoft store should also categorise indie games better. Many games are missing under indie. Many that are in gamepass doesn't appear in that list. And many big company games also appear under indie.

Xbox Series X - What's gone compared to the Xbox One consoles ?,elangab,"We are all here waiting and excited for Series X/S, but while we do, I was thinking of what are the things we'll need to say good bye to when switching. That's not saying it's good or bad but just a list. Might also help people to avoid being surprised. Add things if you think I forgot something.

This is true for today's Xbox One. I know that we won't have ""snap"", but this is true for the current version of the OS on Xbox One as well.

* HDMI In port
* IR receiver port
* Option to play non BC games from almost any external hard drive
* IR based media remotes of Xbox One won't work - as it is today we don't have alternative.
* Kinect and Kinect based games
* Might lose USB TV Tuner support - not sure about it
* Might lose OneGuide - not sure about it
* Volume/On-Off for TVs that don't support HDMI-CEC
* Series S **only** - option to play disc based games and movies (very few games are disc only, such as ""LEGO Dimensions"", so keep that in mind if you're playing these).

Feel free to add more, or correct this list if something is wrong.

Better to be informed, and plan ahead!",23,0.8,49,2020-09-25 01:41:40

XSX version for $69.99 same as above except no 10% video game discount which comes out to $70ish after tax

Advice on if I should trade in my One X or keep it as a secondary console for the house?,HankScorpio20,"I was lucky to get a Series X pre order in store at GameStop.

I tried to return to Xbox this upcoming gen,ProfBawbag,"UK folk who pre ordered from Smyths, or more to the point, those who pre ordered the Series X All Access package, have you had your order cancelled yet again? Seems a fair few folk have.

I initially ran into the now infamous  pre order fiasco that both Smyths and GAME had on Tuesday, where you got sent the Direct Debit and got a hard credit check on your credit file, but you couldn't check out.

Smyths then attempted to re launch the pre order scheme yesterday (Wednesday 23/09) and all seemed well again.  The order went through. Second hard credit check from the finance company involved, but i got the product and whilst annoyed, accepted it.  Today got a cancellation from Smyths because they seemed to have screwed up again.  So now, no pre order and a battered and bruised credit report with zero to show for it. 

I like many people swapped over to PS last gen for reasons we all know, so no point dragging that up, but after hearing MS/Xbox go on about their much hyped All Access package I decided to return to Xbox.  I wish I hadn't bought into their hype nor do I intend to return.  I've had less grief buying houses than pre ordering an inane piece of electrical equipment. 

I think my point is, MS should have had this bundle available on their own website rather than relying solely on the car crashes that are both GAME and Smyths. Their websites aren't fit for purpose. I'm not actually too bothered about not getting the console, but I do admit I'm salty asf about my credit file being trashed. MS have to take some responsibility for that. They chose the retailers, they chose the finance company and it was their much lauded finance package that have caused many people needless stress. Where the actual problem lies, I dunno.

I get it, I am but one person.  Won't make a difference if i buy one of their products or not, but needed to vent anyway.  Feel free to tell me how I should just sit back and stfu and accept it.",1,0.53,20,2020-09-25 00:06:29

PSA - You can get up to 3 years of gamepass ultimate for cheap,dwarrior,"With the new Series S/X coming out I'm not sure how many people already have game pass and I figured I'd share this little tip. But to start off this wont work if you already have gamepass ultimate and its only a $1 upgrade if you haven't already used the $1 trial.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently with Microsoft you can upgrade xbox live gold (up to 36 months) to gamepass ultimate for as little as $1. To do this you have to purchase 12 month xbox live gold cards from a retailer, I used Costco as it was $10/card cheaper. Once you have them add them to your account, once all your xbox live gold cards are added visit [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join) and sign up for the 1$ ultimate trial and your done! This automatically converts all your xbox live gold time into gamepass ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to note is as you are adding the xbox live gold cards to your account it will offer you free trials or bonus's for subscribing and such, decline them all. If you are already subscribed to gamepass ultimate instead of a 1:1 transfer, you will only get 1 month of ultimate for every 4 months from an xbox live gold card (so 12 months of gold only gives you 4 months of ultimate). However if your xbox ultimate subscription is a month to month you can simply cancel it and this will still work like normal ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: just to add this still works even if you've already used the gamepass $1 promo, as long as you dont have an active gamepass sub you can upgrade xbox live gold 1:1 but you will be charged for 1 month of gamepass instead of $1 (for me that was $16 cad).

&amp;#x200B;

Have You Been Thinking About Getting Both A PS5 and an Xbox Series X Too?,CompletelyInadequate,"Hello everyone!

With all this talk of gamepass, Xbox having the beast deal in gaming, all their first party studio games coming to gamepass, them buying Bethesda, smart delivery, awesome upfront backwards compatibility, and so on, I've been thinking about getting an Xbox Series X a little later down the road once there's more available everywhere and hopefully a price cut or some awesome bundle comes out. I already got my pre order in for the PS5 from PlayStation directly and I've had every PlayStation since the first one and I've never had an Xbox before only really played them at friend's houses when I was younger but more and more of this GamePass talk and upcoming exclusives have me thinking about inflicting myself with another $500 of damage, what do you think? Do you think it'll be worth it to have both consoles this generation? (the Series S doesn't feel next-gen enough for me I would want 4k and the better specs)

I really hope the game clip system (especially in regards to editing) is completely overhauled for the XSX.,BeavingHeaver,"Don’t get me wrong, MS has made huge strides in terms of making the UI as fast and fluid as possible, however game clips seem to have been forgotten.

At the moment it’s a complete mess imo. Trimming clips is laggy, and when you are finished and it tries to render, it gets stuck at about 75% done, and just stays on an infinite load screen. I don’t understand how the world’s most powerful console’s system struggles to complete a very basic function. 

You also have game clip uploading to Xbox live which seems to take upwards of half an hour, sometimes longer in my experience. Surely this should be a matter of seconds, minutes at most. 

There is also Upload Studio which has not seen any updates in months. I really loved utilising that when it first came out but then they seemed to give up on it. 

It would be great if they could streamline this whole aspect more so it actually works in terms of editing and uploading.

Gamestop and Xbox All Access Pass for Series X,Servovestri,"So on the preorder day, I did the Gamestop waiting in line and got through with supposedly stock left for the Series X.  I did the All Access Pass, went through the credit check, got all the way to complete and then it failed.  I didn't think anything of it, but come yesterday I find that the Citizen's credit line was opened.

Gamestop doesn't show the order going through.  I reached out through their online form (haven't called yet).  I'm going to assume the credit went through but the order didn't.  Should I just leave it open at this point if I plan on doing the All Access Pass at some point?  Anyone else have this issue?

Update: I got the order email today and was able to complete the order.  Got a confirmation too.  I'm glad Gamestop came though on this one!",5,0.77,23,2020-09-24 22:01:03

Do y'all think a reason the stock cluld be so for the early preorders be due to the fact Microsoft and Sony want more profit?

Did I make the right decision?,wesleycrushedit,"On an impulse, I dropped 699 (Singapore dollars) on the Xbox Series X pre-order. The retailer was running a promo with my credit card (25 bucks off plus a month of Xbox All Access). I was holding off on buying another console coz I just built a new PC in the hope of getting the next gen of graphics cards. But guys. Seriously the price delta is just no Bueno.

I dropped around a grand to build almost from the ground up (I had some leftover SATA SSDs, and an old GTX 970) and it's a great daily driver / straightforward 1080p gaming...

But honestly I think going Xbox was the right choice. The exclusives game is getting interesting with the Bethesda acquisition and even without it I think Microsoft's strategy is fundamentally different from PS5 or even playing on a PC, plus I have a 4K TV...

"Xbox has completely revived itself from the dead in the last two years, but it still has a small yet glaring issue",qwerty28112003," Idfk why even F2P games need Xbox live gold, I mean there's a reason they're called F2P games. And I don't know why Xbox is so petty that they're still locking F2P games behind a paywall. Now I don't have a Xbox one, I play on PC but I've seen Xbox locking games like apex or fortnite behind gold. This is just not good. I'm happy that they're offering a lot of value for their subscriptions. I believe that gamepass offers an insane value for 10-15$. I'm happy to play flight simulator 2020, the outer worlds, subnautica, Ori and Halo MCC using gamepass for my PC. And they're just giving us so much more by teaming up with EA play and giving us all Bethesda titles too on gamepass and offering us a mostly practical way of streaming games. But this doesn't change the fact that they're still locking games behind a paywall which even Sony or even greedy Nintendo gives you for free. This is honestly such a dick move and I don't think anyone benefits from it. I'll soon switch to a series X and I will pay for gamepass ultimate. It's very much worth the price for 10$. But please, Xbox, don't force me to pay you up! How much ever the value the gamepass offers, some people won't just be able to afford it. 10-15$ a month for a subscription isn't really cheap even in my eyes. Many people would consider it expensive, even considering the insane value it offers. And these people usually play f2p games too. Hell most people atleast play one f2p battleroyale now. But forcing these people to pay up isn't really effective at all. You're hardly going to extract money that way. You'll just make these people resent you. It Xbox/microsoft is rich enough to buy up one of the largest gaming studios in the industry for 7.5 billion $, can't they bear the cost of hosting some players on f2p games on their servers? This is just downright petty. I hope Xbox fixes this but I guess nobody will understand this post and call me some kind of Sony fanboy.",0,0.35,9,2020-09-24 13:16:49

How you can upgrade games to Xbox Series X|S with Smart Delivery,Ashaika,,37,0.83,1,2020-09-24 18:57:54
Why the Xbox Series S is fine,TrantaLocked,"Let's look at what the Series S actually is and the implications for game development.

The Series S has the same CPU as the Series X but at 200 Mhz lower frequency; a negligible difference. It has the same SSD speed. The RAM is half as fast with 6GB less capacity, and the GPU is about a third as powerful as the Series X. What I believe is actually going to happen is that games for Series X|S will be first designed around the Series X, with textures then down scaled and internal resolution lowered for the Series S version. This will not be a problem for developers. The engine runs on the CPU, and any SSD asset streaming will also be unaffected. The RAM and GPU bottlenecks can easily be accounted for by first lowering resolution of textures and internal resolution rendering, then lowering sampling level of effects, and then in the worst case scenario just setting a lower frame rate target for the S in case the target is 60 FPS or higher on the X.

I was originally thinking the memory performance parity will be a huge problem, but based on the information we know I've reasoned that Xbox games will *not* need to be built around the S as the baseline, rather may around the X, as scaling down for assets and resolution is quite easy compared to readjusting the entire game for a weaker CPU (which again is not the case here). People who buy the S knowing it's unprecedently cheap for a launch Xbox console will be ok with this situation; they know they were making a small sacrifice for a smaller and cheaper device. Xbox has shown it will have good value this generation. 

I wrote this post because I'm sure there are many of you like me who were nervous about the Series S situation, and not only it potentially holding back Xbox Series X but possibly the entire console generation. I firmly believe this will not be the case. Thanks!",0,0.44,23,2020-09-24 18:42:05

"MS/Xbox, Zenimax/Bethesda, Sony/PS5 and the future?",Saruvat,"Hi...I tried posting this in r/xbox but was not allowed. I hope you don't mind me posting here.

Anyway I've been thinking about this on and off since the big announcement. Just a few days ago I was deadset on getting the PS5 (I'm a current PS4 Pro owner), but Sony's mixed messaging, lack of exclusives which I want to play, Xbox Game Pass and MS's purchase has me leaning towards an Xbox Series X (I'll likely still get a PS5 once the good exclusives come out). Whilst making my decision I thought of the following possibilities - would like to know what you all think.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Maybe MS and Sony come to some sort of quid pro quo agreement, e.g. ""We'll give you Starfield if you give us XXX"" - this is inline with Phil's vision of opening gaming up to everyone. If Sony fully leverages the PS5's haptic controller, SSD and Tempest 3D so that the best playing experience for their 1st party games is on the PS5, they'll have less to worry about. I can kind of see this happening. Maybe they'll have Minimum Advertised prices, e.g. ""If I let you have this game you can only sell it for $##"" thus ensuring accessibility but a guaranteed cheaper price on their own platform. I really don't know. But if it happens I think it would be a win for MS.
2. Maybe timed exclusives for MS. The games will be on Xbox/GP then *maybe* allowed to PS5. I just don't see this happening though. I really don't see MS giving up their games just for cash. If so, why buy Zenimax in the first place? Why not just come to an agreement to always have their games on GP? MS bought ownership for a reason.
3. Sony/PS5 pays for access. Somewhat the inverse of timed exclusives. So instead of paying to have a game earlier than MS, Sony pays just to have any access at all. Again I don't see this happening, MS is not in this just for money. They're pursuing something grander.
4. MS shares nerfed / inferior game quality, e.g. 1080/1440p for PS5, 4k for Xbox. To me this is an interesting strategy. MS has already set the table with the Series S. Maybe they give the Series S versions to PS5 to fulfil the ""opening gaming up for everyone"" but keep the 4k to themselves and Game Pass. I'm not sure if Sony can do the same, i.e. offer nerfed versions of their exclusives. Or if they would even want to.

These were only my thoughts - I've no evidence either way and I'm also sure there are other scenarios. It would be interesting if Scenario 1 or 4 happens though.

What do you all think will happen?",0,0.5,26,2020-09-24 17:56:46
Series S memory,kingh29,"Hello, so I have a Series S on pre-order and I just wanted to make sure I am right about the memory situation. From what I understand, I can use any USB 3.1 storage device to hold any games not designed for the Series S and play them from the hard drive. However, if I want to be able to have extra storage for new games, it has to be on the console or on the Seagate SSD hard drive? My plan is to keep any new games that come out on the console and then older ones from Games Pass on an external hard drive. I just wanted to check that if I got say, an old COD game, it would not count as a next gen game if I get it on the console, so I could store it and play it from the USB 3.1 hard drive?

Phil Spencer - the best thing to happen to Xbox since Halo,honkyjesuseternal,"Just a few weeks ago, people were calling for his job. Phil Spencer has shifted focus not only for Xbox, but Microsoft, and has put in place a plan for the next 5-8 years. 

When he took over for the disgraced Don Mattrick, Xbox was in shambles. They knew they had to get rid of Kinect, and in the process take away their whole plan for the past years. They took the in-game tumor that was Kinect and erased it. They worked on things like Xbox back compatibility and made it a reality. They didn't completely buy in the doomed VR phases of the game industry. They shied away from spending money on ""exclusive content"" as that would bring more trouble.

What they did do is acquire and put some love into several more studios, create the best value in gaming in Game Pass, and create good will with their consumer base who just wanted great games on a great ecosystem/platform. The future is bright because of Phil, and while he did axe projects because they were dead in the water he also made Crackdown 3 happen, which is a game I really enjoyed almost as much as the first. He also has put money and his own stature at Microsoft on the bet of a better Xbox. The one many of us are trying to preorder with no luck.

It will be my first time trying Xbox (also a reason I bought the Series S and not the X) and I'm quite excited but I have two questions since all I've had in my life are Playstation and Nintendo consoles.

1- How does the store works in terms of regions? I'm used to Playstation's regional stores where the USA has one store, Mexico another, EU another and so on. Is this the same with Xbox? Or how does the store work?

2- How does the pay $1 to convert gold to ultimate work? I've seen many people talk about it and I'm confused. Let's say I buy 3 months of gold and activate it when I get my Series S and I can just pay $1 to convert those 3 gold months into ultimate ones?

Thanks in advance.",2,0.75,3,2020-09-24 04:08:59

Has anyone successfully switched their payment method on a Microsoft.com pre-order from credit card to Microsoft Account balance?,ifiranthezoo,"Microsoft customer service told me this was not possible, because to do that they would need to cancel my current preorder and set up a new one to be using the account balance, and they can’t do that while the current stock is sold out. They said there is no way to edit a current preorder to accomplish that change. But i’m skeptical....

UPDATE: I called the Microsoft store customer support on 9/26 and they were able to successfully switch my payment method to be entirely my Microsoft account balance instead of credit card. The customer service rep didn’t seem like he knew how to make that switch at first, but after putting me on hold a few times and talking to his co-workers, he figured it out.",3,0.8,18,2020-09-24 03:59:04

Preorder Credit Card Question,breakngbad,"Sorry if this question has already been answered. 

I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge of if Microsoft (where I preordered my Xbox series x from) would outright cancel a preorder if the credit card I put on there declined. When I say declined, it doesn’t mean I don’t have the credit (I have more than enough) but sometimes Capital One will decline my credit card if I charged an expensive order and will text me to make sure I was the one that bought that and not a scammer.

Once I text back yes, they say to try to pay again and it won’t get declined the next time. This has happened once when I bought a $250 tv from target.

Anyone know if Microsoft will reach out or outright cancel the preorder if this happens? Or know what to do? I called Capital One and they basically said they don’t know if fraud detection will happen but if it does to call them when it happens (not helpful I know).",5,0.85,6,2020-09-24 03:41:05
For those of us with credit hits from approved Citizens One financing on failed Preorders,sarasotatim,"Whew....just now I received a welcome email (finally) from Citizens One saying congrats on my All Access approval, and gave me a service website and account number to use and get all my information. So when systems are available, we should be able to just use this account number for purchase, as it is basically a line of credit.

All day yesterday I was thinking it would be a big issue and have to go through another credit hit when systems were finally available, but looks like we're ok, I'm hoping you guys get one of these emails too :)

**UPDATE:** Was able to setup an account/login with the account number given, and gives me controls to manage payments (when I actually am able to buy one) and shows my credit limit.",13,0.79,30,2020-09-24 03:34:03

Who else with a failed All Access preorder just got a Citizens One alert about their new line of credit?,FOR_WORK123,"Absolute fucking disaster lol. 

I tried to grab a Series X on Gamestop yesterday via All Access (since it would be more convenient for me to space out the payments instead of paying all at once). I was under the assumption that a certain number of consoles were being held separately, so that people would have enough time to get through the credit line application and grab a preorder. 

I successfully completed the Citizens One credit line application but, after getting approved by Citizens One, hit the ""SORRY WE'RE OUT OF STOCK NOW!"" error on Gamestop and thus didn't get my All Access preorder in. An hour or so later, Citizen One's credit check shows up as a hard pull on Equifax, which is irritating considering it didn't actually serve a purpose. 

Today, I've now received an email from Citizens One that my line of credit is **active ($2,500 lol)** and my online portal is ready for activation. I just got off the phone with Citizens One customer service who claim the account will be deactivated in 30 days and allege the account deactivation won't hurt my credit score, but still — this fuckin sucks!

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
Do not try to order an Xbox with the All Access program if there's any risk of consoles going out of stock during the process. I imagine this risk will persist for the remainder of preorders and holiday shopping. (And avoid applying for a payment plans for any electronic devices, because getting a line of credit for one product alone involves risks like this and is also unfortunately kind of dumb)",26,0.92,51,2020-09-24 03:22:48

Basically what I will be doing is buying 3 one year live gold cards and putting them into my account when I get the Xbox and then just convert using the 1$ method. My question is if we can only convert live to game pass by using the 1$ game pass way and if so do you have any idea how long will this 1$ promo stay active for as I will be getting the XSX in about a year, Thanks.",0,0.5,11,2020-09-24 02:45:27

Xbox Gamepass business model - How do publishers monetize the service?,klipseracer,"I know the details are locked down but I've seen some of them leak out. My understanding is that there is a lump sum for agreeing to bring your game to the service, at least for some titles. And then afterward, I'm guessing there is a chunk of the total revenue which is divided up among the titles which are listed in game pass and that is paid out based on play hours. Since the revenue comes in on a monthly basis, it makes sense to me they would go this route.

I like this because its really a performance based situation, if you put a massive title like COD in there and tons of people play it, they get the lions share of the money. Maybe not as much as releasing it stand alone but you also get the chance to acquire new customers you wouldn't have had otherwise which has positive secondary benefits.

If you are a small indie who happens to put out a really awesome game, you get rewarded with huge money.  It would seem to me that companies would stand to gain by letting people know their title is in Gamepass to increase their play hours. With Microsoft's shift to active users and play time metrics, it seems to fall in line with expectations.

I don't know how other services like Spotify compensate artists/studios, anyone have insight into this?",1,0.57,6,2020-09-24 02:35:01

Is preorder price higher?

But in the case of the Xbox, it is costing much more. Retailers and the official Xbox page for my country cost much more (like 30% than the retail price) and I am wondering if maybe its just because of the preorder, and the actual console will be a little cheaper one or two weeks after lauch, also considering black friday is comming and retailers in my country do offer decent dicounts on this date as well, can I expect it to be a little cheaper?
