State of mouse and keyboard support on Xbox consoles?,KoeiNL,"I'm buying  Series X regardless of mouse and keyboard support, but I was wondering what the current state of it is? On my PC I mainly play shooters and when I'm playing on a console with a controller it feels like I'm drunk. Its just so incredibly slow and inaccurate. From what I understand some games support mouse and keyboard in single player? Is that true for most shooters? I don't really care about multiplayer games anymore, but I would like to play titles like Doom with a mouse and keyboard. Is that possible?",2,1.0,4,2020-09-28 17:19:06

TV upgrade for the Series X,MeesaMeeseeks,"So for my price range the only two real options are the Vizio M8 and the TCL 6 series both in 55 inches. The Vizio im sold on, but the TCL can do 1440p 120 which I am very interested in since it seems to be the only TV I can realistically afford that has a 120 panel. However, it seems the TCL has blooming issues around text, and every video ive seen the black crush is insanely bad. Anyone have experience with the TCL? Is the blooming and black crush really that bad, or is it just youtube videos exaggerating how bad it is? By comparison the Vizio doesnt seem to crush blacks in any videos ive watched. I really want that 120 frames for multiplayer, but the black crush seems beyond noticable.",1,1.0,2,2020-09-28 17:06:30

Switching to console after 8 years of pc gaming with GOD tier PCs,Additional_Piglet755,"Main reasons but not all of them are: 

Console simplicity is a thing of beauty. 
Xbox achievements really add a lot to games imo. 
I’m tired of having all these different platforms within windows to launch my games from. Currently using 5 different launchers... 
There’s practically zero HDR on pc games and when they do support it windows HDR doesn’t work at all. 
Cheaters on pc is real, and it’s annoying. Big time
Games on console are easier to dev for and MUCH more optimized. 1/5 or 1/4 times I buy a triple A game on pc, it will have serious or game breaking issues. 
Most pc exclusive games that are worth playing could be played on a laptop and don’t require any legit power... 

And finally the old argument that PC gaming is cheaper is honestly kinda dead. As a pc gamer I can tell you, it’s not cheaper unless you want a bellow average experience. 

The new Xbox series X can run games at 4k native, HDR, and 60fps. To build a pc that can run games like that you’d need to shell out at LEAST 1500 dollars. This is coming from a long time pc gamer here. 

Also, the SSD speeds on the new Xbox X are legitimately faster in games than ANY SSD money can buy for a PC. 

I could also write a novel on how frustrating windows is as a gaming platform.

Overall, I’m very excited to join the awesome Xbox community and start playing on Xbox X this November ! &lt;3",20,0.82,11,2020-09-28 16:43:22

"What is the ""most next gen game"" I should get or have for my Series X?",HankScorpio20,"Former PlayStation guy. Went all in on Xbox starting in April. Been buying lots of games I either had on PlayStation or newer games. Just games in general to have a nice collection ready for Series X. Have all my games ready in my 2TB so day one I just plug it in and transfer games to the SSD to take advantage of it. But now I'm thinking what is the most next gen game I can buy to blow my mind away on launch?

Day one PS4 owner and the game I just had to get was Killzone Shadow Fall. That looked next gen to me at the time. And even though I'm not a fan of the genre, Demon Souls to me is the most next gen game I've seen this time.

Now I keep throwing around ""most next gen game"". What i mean by that, what's the most visually impressive game available for when I get my Series X home? I can't do much about performance cuz I own a 60hz 4K HDR TV. So I can't even do 120hz. But what's the prettiest looking game is what it comes down to?

Looking forward to seeing any boosts to RDR 2, Halo MCC, Halo 5, Gears of War. Also hyped to see how next gen NBA 2K21 looks and how good COD will be. The most obvious one should be Cyberpunk but I'm apprehensive of calling it truly next gen cuz the game we buy will be the One X version. Which will no doubt he gorgeous but the upgrade isn't till next year and I'm sure THAT will be the most impressive looking game of 2021.",14,0.82,41,2020-09-28 12:22:07

Xbox Series X Warranty,Tantstradamus,I wasn’t able to preorder an XSX myself but luckily my friend I know personally was able to get 2. I was able to buy one off him for $500 and it is shipping from Target. He just changed the shipping address to mine but it’s still under his name.

Settup Up Multiple Xbox in the House,sleeperx,"I currently have an Xbox One S and I'm planning to get an Xbox Series X.  I am signed into the S under my own account and my kid has played games under it for a long time.  So, my account is pretty much mixed up with my own friends and his friends.  I want him to have his own account so that we can seperate that.  Some questions though.

1. I'm guessing he'd have to re add all his friends and I can boot them off mine.  How would it work for games like Fortnite?  How can I transfer all that to his account?
2. To continue using the One S, I guess I set the X to Home(?) and S as an additional one?
3. Would I set up both of our accounts on each Xbox and then we can just sign in as needed?
4. How would game sharing work?  Xbox gold pass?  Would I be able to share my purchases with him?  And vice versa?

Time to knock sense into people. Zenimax property like Bethesda will be only on Xbox ecosystem. It's not rocket and science. It's business.,stormbringervane,"I saw many conversation about many fans who concerned about whether they can play MS PROPERTY games on others platform. The answer is **YES** and **NO**. You can play their game on any platform- **PC/Xbox or Mobile** but it's only in **THEIR Ecosystem** aka MS/Xbox ecosystem. 

The facts of matter is:
- It's not ""exclusive"" or anti consumer/ It's BUSINESS. Take a look at your restaurant, take a look at your house, take a look at Coca and Pepsi or Netflix. No Restaurant or anybody SHARE their secret sauces. If MC Donald, Coca produce their ingrident for their softdrink. Why would they share their invention to others? 

You see the point here? **Xbox want people to drag into their ecosystem**. The **same** way that ALL others company in the world is doing. They own property, they won't share it to others. **What in the world you are living to believe Intel will Produce chip for AMD? Or Netflix content will be on Disney plus** 

Anothers major facts: Console market is less than 10%. PC is 48% and the rest is mobile.  So ""losing"" PS market is NONSENSE. PS fan will be attracted to MS ecosystem if they want to play MS property.  MS are too big like Netflix that they don't care much about console sales, their majority focus right is now is on Cloud. Which mean mostly PC+Mobile which are over 70% of market share.   The ""lost"" in PS or nintendo is NOTHING, compare to what they gain. Fame, Playerbase and Money",69,0.7,89,2020-09-28 10:31:47
"Beginner's Guide to XSX/XSS, Game Pass, Storage, and More!",Xbox_Live_User,"Welcome to the Xbox family!

The next generation of consoles is coming, as are tons of questions.

This post provides guides and resources that cover the basics of the current state of Xbox. If you're new to Xbox, read **Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass** first.

Before you proceed, please check the [FAQ tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/faq) or [Info tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/wiki/information) from [r/XboxSeriesX](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX) for more information, guides, and helpful links.

# Xbox Live/EA Play/Game Pass

* **Xbox Live Gold (XBL) (US $9.99 monthly):** Allows online multiplayer. Free games every month through Games with Gold. [Click here to join Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live)
* **EA Play (US $4.99 monthly):** Library of older games published by EA. New games are added 6-9 months after release.
* **Game Pass for PC/Game Pass for Console) (US $9.99 monthly):** Game subscription service providing access to over 200 Microsoft and third-party games. First-party MS games stay forever while third-party titles are timed. Game Pass for PC includes EA Play as of Holiday 2020 (Game Pass for console does **NOT** include EA play!)* (corrected)
* **xCloud** \- Cloud game streaming service for mobile access to select Game Pass titles. Still in Beta and not available as a standalone product.
* **Game Pass Ultimate (GPU) (US $14.99 monthly):** Includes Xbox Live Gold, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, Game Pass for Console, and xCloud in one package.

## Game Pass Ultimate And XBL Conversion For $1

Microsoft currently allows you to convert Xbox Live Gold time and Game Pass for PC or Console time to Game Pass Ultimate time at a 1:1 ratio for either $1 or $14.99, based on your eligibility and up to a maximum of 36 months (three years). The estimated savings for the full three years if you buy XBL at retail price is at least US $359* (corrected).

A loophole in this policy allows you to buy up to three years of XBL, redeem it to your Microsoft account, and convert it to GPU. While you don't have to get three years, you save the most money this way.

* When will this promotion end? **No date confirmed**
* Can I do this if I have before? **Yes**
* Can I do this if I currently have a GPU subscription active? **No, adding XBL to your account converts at a 3/1 ratio**
* Can I do this if I currently have a Game Pass for PC or Console subscription active? **Yes**
* Can I do this without an Xbox? **Yes**
* Can I buy XBL from a different region where it's cheaper? **Yes, but you must use a VPN and you may experience region issues with the code redemptions**
* Can I do this if I am no longer eligible for the $1 promotion price? **Yes, but you must make a one-time US $14.99 payment instead of $1**

**Note:** If the total time (XBL + Game Pass time) in your account is more than 36 months, use a PC to activate the promotion. Any time over the 36 month maximum will **disappear**.

### Instructions

1. On your [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/services), turn off any existing recurring billing for Game Pass or XBL.
2. Purchase three 12-month Xbox Live Gold cards for your region from a retailer like Amazon, Microsoft, Costco, CDKeys, or others. **Note:** CDKeys is a ""gray market"" site that sells these cards at steep discounts. They're easy to use and reliable.
3. Visit [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com/) and redeem each XBL key. For each key, turn off the recurring billing toggle before you click **Submit**.
4. Check that you have at least 36 months of time on your account (XBL time + Game Pass time).
5. Visit the [Xbox Game Pass page](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) for your region and click **Join Now**.
6. Click **Join for $1** under *Ultimate*.
7. Follow the prompts and provide your payment information when asked.

You should see that all your Game Pass and XBL time now says *upgraded to Game Pass Ultimate* in your Microsoft account.

# Backwards Compatibility

The new Xbox consoles support all Xbox One titles as well as any Xbox/Xbox 360 titles that are already supported on Xbox One.  
You may experience improvements to load times, framerate, and resolution.

Kinect and headsets with optical sound connectors are not currently supported.

# Expanding Storage

The new Xbox consoles have a storage expansion slot. Currently the only supported storage for this slot is the [Seagate Expansion Card](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-1tb-expansion-card). You can install games here and play them directly from the card.

While pricey, cheaper third-party alternatives are inevitable down the road.

You can also use an external USB HDD or SSD to store Series X or S games that you aren't playing. You can't play these directly from the drives and need to transfer them back to supported storage.

You can use an external drive to play non-enhanced backwards-compatible games from the Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox.

For a quick reference, see [this diagram](https://i.imgur.com/AwGKbwu.jpg) (courtesy [u/beateride](https://www.reddit.com/u/beateride)) and [Xbox Expansion Explained](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/24/xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s-custom-storage-solution-primer/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) for more detailed information.

# Xbox All Access

[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access)

Xbox All Access is a monthly payment option which gives you a console and two years of GPU. The Xbox Series S is $24.99 a month and the Xbox Series X is $34.99, in the U.S.

All Access involves opening a line of credit with a local credit issuer through the Microsoft-authorized service provider in your area. This means a credit check that usually impacts your credit score.

To see if All Access is available in your region, see the [supported regions list](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/09/xbox-all-access-expands-to-12-countries-this-holiday/).

# Bethesda Acquistion

There is no confirmation on if Xbox will make Bethesda games exclusive. Phil Spencer said it will be on a ""case-by-case basis"" for console exclusivity.

All Bethesda games are set to be added and launched on Game Pass.

"XBOX IP shuffle! Now that Xbox owns all of this great IP and all these great studios, which studio should make which IP?",jmottss,"EDIT 1: This is purely a hypothetical question. I do not expect MS to start swapping IPs between studios. Just thought it’d be interesting to imagine what some of these studios could do with different IP.  Please don’t take this too seriously. 

What do y’all think would be a cool match up of Xbox owned IP and studio? Here’s what I got:

Ninja theory: DOOM

I think Ninja theory could do some crazy stuff with the DOOM IP. Obviously don’t call it DOOM and don’t make it an FPS. 

Double Fine: Viva Piñata or Banjo

Playground: MS Flight Sim “horizon”

Basically the same thing they did for Forza but for flight sim. Give us an arcade open world version of MS flight sim with the “sim” portion toned way down and more fun shit to do. 

The Coalition: Trenched

MOJANG: Halo

Not a mainline Halo entry, just some cool side story spin off craziness. I could even just see Minecraft, but set on a Halo ring.

"Graphics or the expanded gameplay possibilities, which excites you more?",CasraTX,"With this next generation of consoles, be the Series X or the PS5, both will be beasts.   My first console was an Atari 2600, looking back over the many.. many, years of gaming.  While the graphics were always the ""wow factor"" it's the better gameplay in the end that has marked for me the biggest difference.  Mario 64, great example.  A 2d side scroller turned into a 3d exploration platformer.  The graphics yes, were amazing (for the time young ones) but the GAMEPLAY made the difference.  Even FFVII vs it's predecessors.  Yes the graphics catch the eye but the bigger gameplay.  


So I was talking to a friend who said it's all about that 4-8k high FPS graphics, but for me the bigger gameworlds, t he more immersive gameplay is what has me excited.  What say you?",5,0.99,15,2020-09-28 06:23:08

Are JRPG (and jap. games in general) fans just a vocal minority?,mangabernd,"We had many exclusive shmups and JRPG on the 360 and nothing on the One. Now the standard narrative is ""They don't sell on Xbox"" but is that really the case?

Nier Automata did really good and BandaiNamco and SquareEnix release all the big titles, Kemco ports all the mobile SNES-style JRPG and we finally got Yakuza, Kingdom Hearts and will get Dragon Quest 11.

Are fans of japanese games just a vocal minority? Every comment section of a new trailer, game reveal or news article is filled with comments of fans who want those games. Genshin Impact releases tomorrow on EVERY platform - except Xbox. Same with Ryza 2 later this year. Wonderful101 remake was announced for Xbox and removed later during the Kickstarter.

Atlus was surprised how good Persona sold on Steam and they want to port more. They still skip Xbox even though Sega sees how well their games do on Gamepass. I'm fine with digital only releases because the print runs are apparently way too big for those niche titles.

Let's talk about the other studios a part of the Bethesda deal,watchmensmile77,"If you are an Xbox fan is been a rollercoaster high week with the acquisition of Bethesda/Zenimax. It has been at this point discussed extensively what the acquisition means debated whether the games will go to other consoles and what the big studios will offer. For Bethesda Softworks, ID Software, Zenimax Online, and to some extent Machine Games and Arkane. We know the IP's: Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield, Doom, Wolfenstein, Dishonored, Evil Within, Quake, and Ghost Wire. 

We know that Arkane is doing Deathloop and working on new IP your guess is as good as mine as to what that is whether they continue Dishonored or do something else. Machine Games could work on new IP after putting out 3 or 4 Wolfenstein games or continue with spin-offs. Tango is locked on Ghostwire and Evil Within. The interesting conversation is Alpha Dog and Roundhouse.

Both are studios that are actually under Bethesda and not independent studios under Zenimax. One is a studio concentrated on mobile games and the other is Human Head re-branded. These are more like support AA studios. There are 3 options for the direction of these studios they stay the same, they stay the same and become support studios, or they grow and shift direction and become studios that do new IP or work on existing Bethesda IP in new ways or Microsoft IP.

   So what am I getting at you have Blades and Fallout Shelter plus current games that are on mobile for Alpha Dog to help Bethesda with and their games. Those are games with tens or hundreds of million players that can go to X Cloud as Shelter is already on Xbox and we may see a new version of that. There is also a huge opportunity for these studios to expand and certain IP that can our huge opportunities to continue on Xbox and now have the manpower and dev assets to plan that out. I am talking of Mech Assault as part of the Battletech Series and Killer Instinct. Mech Assault could be a great direction for Machine Games if they take a break from Wolfenstein but you can get several studios working on a project like that and provide a mech game with an awesome engine and shooting mechanics and invest in the lore and be narrative-driven. Killer Instinct with Roundhouse or help remasters or remake Ryse Son of Rome with Crytek. This is speculation and what I might like to see that can be done. What are yours? What do you think should or will be done with these lesser-known studios or even possibly studios at a crossroads and not as monetarily successful as Bethesda and ID but that can be invested in and have massive potentials like Arkane, Tango, and Machine.

Slipspace Engine rumored 500 million development cost makes sense with Zenimax acquisition,SagitariiusA,"The rumor that halo infinite development so far cost 500 million and that most time was spent on the slipspace engine may actually make sense with this acquisition. If MS planned to acquire Zenimax for years, developing a new engine for titles that long have used out dated engines such as Fallout, would totally make sense, it enables those future zenimax games that need a new engine to immediately have one available to them, and not need 3-5 years for engine development plus 3-5 years for game development. Could a future fallout game, or Elder scrolls, be built on the slipspace engine?

I only ask, because I don't want to, say, buy it on the Xbox One, and it only be playable on the Xbox One. Or similarly, I don't want to go to buy it on the Series X, and it by the Series X version that doesn't release for another year or two.

I know most third party games leave Game Pass eventually. This don't worries me because If I played the game and I liked it I just buy the game.

Now is the time for Xbox to hit hard and go full steam. Amazon Luna is on paper a huge threat,Viperaaspis,"Amazon Luna has huge international coverage. The Twitch integration is an advantage. Twitch is the number one streaming platform and Twitch streamers will promote Amazon Luna. Amazon is a trillion dollar company and its AWS has twice the servers market share as Microsoft's Azure. 

Their Ubisoft deal is a plus too. They call it Ubisoft channel with their new games available on day one. This implies that their will be other channels. 

Speculation: What if PlayStation makes a deal with Amazon? PSnow is already a streaming service, combined with Amazon Luna offer, it can become a stiff competitor to xCloud. 

Amazon Luna has just been announced. We still haven't seen it in action yet. Therefore, if Xbox keeps building on its momentum, keeps pushing games out and if, this is something their are lacking doing, they start to do more TV commercials and all sorts of adverts, then a comfortable advance can be built.

I am quite confident that when DF will post their Xbox Series X video, it will boost the sales even further up. 

I don't know if this post will be pushed away as being uninteresting, or too speculative. 

If not:

Do you foresee an Amazon Playstion deal?

What do you think Xbox should do to improve its market share?

Are you confident in xCloud's long lasting future?

Xbox advantage over Luna, is their Studios, can you think about something else and share it?

The difference between this launch and previous ones,MoistMorsel1,"Do you remember the xbox one launch?  Aside from the kinnect only games, there weren't that many that could not be played on the xbox 360.  Forza, assassins creed Black flag, call of doodie ghosts, lego marvel superheroes.  I think, of all of these games, the only ones that were next gen only were dead rising 3 and ryse, and I wonder if these games **really** couldnt have played on the xbox 360 too.

This gen there is alot of focus on **true** next gen titles.  With Xbox setting the way and saying everything will be playable on XB1 the initial reaction was ""XB1 will hold games back"" but, now that Sony have decided to cash in too, this is no longer a problem.  Curious huh!  But anyways, I digress.

I've been looking at the titles and this time the only next gen title is the medium, which is fine.  But I wonder why it is such an issue for so many people.

In reality every game over the next couple of years will have had some sort of development on the XB1 (Or in GTAVs case, the XB 360).  Which means the majority of games could have worked on the XB1.  So why shouldn't they?

I appreciate some people want that next generation feel but here I am thinking all of these games will look better on the next gen consoles and, if you haven't played a game, what's the problem with a next gen update?  They could just have held off the release of these games and pegged them as a ""next gen only"" launch titles, but what is the point if it *could* be made to play on multiple generations?

Then I look at titles like gears 5 ultimate, being updated for next gen.  Ironic that if it were not released last year, and the back compat was removed, people wouldn't be questioning if it were next gen or not.  Personally...I haven't played a load of the games that are being ""enhanced"" for next gen yet due to time, and I cant imagine I'm the only one.  So does that make them ""next gen""?

I guess I'm just poking at the thought that, it doesnt really matter where a game was released first (bright memory for example).  If the game is good then we have plenty to be excited about.  A shit game will always be a shit game - even if it maxes out an RTX 3090 and other top of the range hardware.

The Actual Reason X1SX Enhanced Requires the NVME SSD?,darkonex,"So I've just been thinking and I can't really grasp the reason why XBox One Series X enhanced games have to be run from the NVME.  I mean on my PC I can run 4k games at 60fps regardless if I'm using my NVME drive, my SATA SSD drive, or my external 5400RPM HDD.  So what exactly makes the X1SX so special that it absolutely requires them to be run from the internal or the addon NVME?  Also don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on XB at all, I absolutely love Xbox and I have the Series X preordered along with the PS5 and I'm more excited about the Series X so this isn't a hate thing.  I'm truly just curious and can't understand why this is required technically.",0,0.2,24,2020-09-27 16:08:37

Hopefully MS acquisition of Bethesda will be a chance to produce quality RPGs that are more similar to old titles than recent ones.,Dorjcal,"I really hope that the acquisition brings new ideas and creativity to the RPG division because I always felt that the quality of the games got worse and worse with each title. 
Beside the micro transaction stuff, I always felt that they kept dumbing down their game to cater to larger audiences. Now with gamepass that problem is over so I really wish they looked at the past rather than the recent games.

Morrowind is by far better than Oblivion, which in turn is better than Skyrim. Of course Skyrim has the prettier graphics, but nothing can beat the sense of immersion and customization that I had with Morrowind. 

Obviously we don’t even have to talk about Falliut 76.., but I always felt that Fallout 3 experience was superior to Fallout 4.

Probably this is an unpopular opinion, but I wanted to know if there is anyone out there that shares my thoughts.

And if haven’t already: Play Morrowind!!!!",50,0.78,21,2020-09-27 14:54:15
I hope there will be more Xbox Play Anywhere games this generation,ActualWolverine,"I play on xbox and pc. I love that for some games, I can buy them on one platform and play them on any, usually also with cross-save. Its a huge selling point for me. The only down side is that there are very few games that support xbox play anywhere. All the microsoft exclusives are on there, but I don't buy many microsoft exclusives because I have gamepass ultimate. 

I can see why publishers don't want crossbuy, I mean, I owned 4 copies of gta 5 on different platforms, 2 copies of far cry 4, 3 copies of assassins creed brotherhood, and 3 copies of skyrim. But I only buy them for nostolgia, I'm still far more likely to buy a new game in the first place if it has xbox play anywhere, like I bought forza horizon 3, and cuphead.",23,0.84,9,2020-09-27 14:43:45
XSX or upgrading my PC,ser6651,"So I currently have a ryzen 2600 with rx 580. I am in a weird spot regarding what path to take. Please discuss

Points favouring upgrading PC:
1.Planning upgrade to a 3060 or AMD equivalent means i will probably have a better GPU than XSX.
2. I already have majority of friends that play on PC not on consoles
3. I already have atleast 150usd worth of games on PC which means i have a small library that I can't bring with me to XSX

Points against upgrading
1. I might only be able to afford a 1080p 144hz monitor which I do not want. 
2. I will have to change my PSU aswell (It's a MasterWatt Lite don't laugh 😭) which adds further cost.
3. I would prefer a 4k TV like TCL P8 because I could watch Netflix and other 4k content on it while being able to play XSX
4. XSX is more portable than lugging around a cpu case
5. Now the most important point. I am entering the phase of my life where I do not think I will have enough time to do upgrades and the usual PC troubleshooting (Even though I am tech savvy enough to do it) I will be an actual registered doctor in 3 months and the 32 hour shifts that come with it are no joke. I would want just a plug and play device which doesn't give me a hassle after a long day at work. I will also ofcourse keep XSX for a few years and might get married and have children in the next 3-4 years which might mean even less time for upgrading and troubleshooting.

P.S please do not recommend PS5 etc. I am not interested in their exclusives and they have no alternative to Game Pass.",3,0.63,27,2020-09-27 14:15:12

Some notes on why the Bethesda acquisition happened and what it means for TES/FO and Xbox going forward,bjj_starter,"ZeniMax/Bethesda were struggling financially a lot before Microsoft acquired them, that's why the owners were trying to sell the company. It's why Bethesda made Elder Scrolls Online and FO76, why they leaned so hard into microtransactions, and they still weren't financially stable. They needed to be acquired to keep the company's finances solvent and be able to continue making games, Microsoft had the money to support them to continue making great games. Be glad that Microsoft bought it, because the bidder they won against was fucking EA, and EA would have absolutely gutted Bethesda Game Studios and everything else under ZeniMax.

Read more about Bethesda's fragility and the potential for an EA acquisition here if you're interested: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/from-banking-scandal-to-video-game-ceo-to-billion-dollar-score

And more about the volatile nature of the industry leading to Bethesda's troubles here: https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/22/xboxs-bethesda-acquisition-is-evidence-of-blockbuster-gamings-volatility/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


Here's an examination of how games acquisitions have gone in the past, noting that EA is five of these examples and they have consistently completely fucked over acquisitions, so it's fantastic that they didn't get Bethesda/ZeniMax: https://www.pcgamer.com/what-happened-to-12-of-gamings-biggest-studios-after-they-were-sold/

And if you're worried because of the two terrible Microsoft examples in that documentary (Ensemble and Lionhead), here's a fantastic documentary on the development of Halo Wars that tells the full story of why Ensemble shut and it's a lot more complicated than just ""Microsoft closed Ensemble"": https://youtu.be/igaB219Ic8c

As for Lionhead, what ruined them was the Kinect bullshit Microsoft was pulling at the start of the Xbox One generation, with Don Mattrick forcing them into making Kinect games. Absolutely, insanely, terrible decision making. Out of touch with Xbox employees and customers and leading to the worst generation launch of Xbox ever. Microsoft removed Don Mattrick and replaced him with Phil Spencer, who ended the Kinect bullshit and has dramatically improved Xbox. Don Mattrick literally did not care about Xbox (https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1102441475898404864?s=19) and Phil Spencer understands exactly what went wrong with the launch and is committed to not repeating those mistakes (https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/). I also find it interesting that if you go back and rewatch that terrible launch, the first time anyone talks about games is 30 minutes in when Phil Spencer shows up to introduce some EA game.

I get why people are worried, and I don't like the industry consolidating or the practice of exclusives either. But Bethesda Game Studios are by far my favourite studios, they were going under without a buyer, and Microsoft outbid EA. EA would have unceremoniously killed TES and Fallout by taking all of the recent Bethesda microtransaction/games as a service shit and turning it up to 11 for every game. At least as Microsoft exclusives, they can make high quality single player games, and the only requirement on the games is that they be desirable enough to drive console sales, aka the games just need to be good, not super profitable, much like God of War.",231,0.94,97,2020-09-27 13:17:22
Placing the SX on top of a subwoofer?,FinalOdyssey,"My setup is a bit limited. I am buying a new TCL 2020 6 Series  soon and I don't expect my current TV stand mount to have the correct VESA hookups for the tv, it's a very old stand from 2008. If it doesn't fit on the mount, I'll have to put the TV directly on the top shelf which isn't a huge deal but I was going to put my SX there. I have other places I can put the SX, but I was wondering if placing it on top of a subwoofer is ok? I am worried that the bass from the woofer might somehow slowly wiggle something loose in the console. I currently have my switch on top of it and it's been fine for a year, but I'm more worried about the SX because it's a more in-depth, complex system. Any opinions?

Is placing items on a subwoofer generally a bad idea? For those interested I have the Samsung K450 soundbar+sub. There is definitely enough room on top of the sub for the SX.",2,0.56,27,2020-09-27 12:43:31

The next Xbox Games Showcase,tim_timmayy,"This has in my opinion been the overall greatest month in Xbox history. The Series S reveal, price and release reveal, preorders selling out in multiple countries, the success of XCloud, Bethesda acquisition, and now sending units to media outlets for gameplay. 

Xbox has a lot of good momentum right now, and they need to keep their foot on the gas pedal until launch. October would be great month for another games showcase. 

Matt Booty said that we haven’t heard from all studios. From the July Showcase we’ve haven’t seen what’s going on with The Coalition, Mojang, Worlds Edge, InExile, Compulsion, and The Initiative. Plus the newly acquired Bethesda studios. 

I also see this as an opportunity to provide insight on the games from studios we’ve not seen, updates on previously announced titles, as well as GamePass promotions. 

Hypothetically speaking I could see The Initiatives Game be the opener. It’s in a playable state, at this point i feel we should at least get a reveal trailer. 

And then towards the end they pass it to their Bethesda Studios. Todd Howard shows Wolfenstein 3, ESO expansion, Doom DLC, shadow drops all Bethesda titles on GP, and then they “and one more thing” and it is Starfield with an April 2021 release date.

Xbox has done a complete 180 since the whole Halo Infinite fiasco.,LoganH1219,"When the gameplay event happened back in July, Xbox didn’t seem like it was in the best place and I think we can all agree with that. No major 1st party launch titles except for Halo Infinite and that game looked very unfinished. No forza, no gears, nothing. It got to the point where, after the Halo Infinite delay, I even considered not preordering the Series X and just waiting a year or so.

But wow they turned it around big time. Phil Spencer style. 

Announcement after announcement. Reveal after reveal. Amazing PR lately. They released MFS, announced game streaming was going public with GPU, announced the very affordable Series S, Xbox all access, game pass additions, Game Pass X EA Play, and who could forget, the purchase of Bethesda!

I’m sure I’m forgetting some other stuff too but they have really made a complete turn around from where they were 2-3 months ago. And they’ve been killing it on social media lately too. I’m honestly so impressed and it makes me happy to see Xbox finally getting the PR it deserves for all its pro-consumer practices such as being able to use your controllers and accessories day one on Xbox Series X|S.

"Very excited for launch! A couple of questions, please",linkx13,"1. I'm not very excited about Xbox's launch games except for Cyberpunk, but I think I'm going to wait for the upgrade. That said, I haven't owned an Xbox in years so I'm fine playing through older games that are awesome. I think the best bet to do this is just get Gamepass, right? Or is there a game I should consider that won't be on Gamepass?

2. I understand that I should buy a few years (up to three) of Xbox gold and upgrade to Gamepass for $1 because it's a great deal, but this is sort of a loophole. The only wrinkle is that I don't actually have an Xbox yet and won't be able to upgrade immediately, so if I buy three years of gold and they change the upgrade so that it's not $1, isn't it possible I could get screwed?",3,0.66,16,2020-09-26 21:54:52

My question is can I share access to games on their accounts so we can game on different devices or can they all just be signed into my account. For example if my wife is playing ori on her gaming pc, I’m playing halo on the series x, and my son is playing untitled goose game on the Xbox one, can we all be doing this simultaneously? I’m just curious since we can do something similar with sharing on steam.

"One account, multiple consoles",smidgeons,"Hey,

If I own a Series S and a Series X, am I able to log into both with one account?

I searched around online and found info about game sharing etc (for people who have kids and share games to their account/machine).  But I don't want to do that, just me, one account at the same address so the same wifi network/ip etc. I'm not account sharing or anything weird.

Just trying to figure out if I can, say log into my series S in the bedroom and access everything I own from there. (or at least things the S can access, such as the digital games i own).

I assume though, if say someone was watching Netflix downstairs the system would log them out if I logged into the series S upstairs.  Not a big issue as I doubt i'd ever need both consoles logged in at the same time anyway, but just struggled to find much info for people who want multiple machines but not for sharing games with other users/accounts.

Think i've just been spoiled by Netflix in that I can watch part of an episode on my PC and then continue watching from where I left off on my TV etc.  I just really like that freedom, so it would be nice for my console to do the same.

Again, not a huge issue. But I was just curious but struggled to find info that wasn't all about  parents/kids to share games.  I just want to be able to log into whatever console I want and access my full account.

I'm pretty sure i will be able to but just wasn't quite sure what dodgy restrictions they might have in place.  Nintendo, for example, are massively annoying in that consoles are tied to accounts for the most part.

Do we know wether Xcloud will support gyro aiming?,Loldimorti,"So one of the big reasons why I planned on getting a PS5 before getting an Xbox is that the Dualsense has a motion sensor that allows for gyro aiming in shooters.

It's something I've grown very accustomed to when playing on Nintendo Switch and at this point I don't think I can go back to standard stick aiming and having to rely on aim assist.

But now it seems like a lot of shooters like Doom, Wolfenstein and Prey are becoming Xbox first party titles. Unfortunately even the new Xbox controller still seems to not have any motion sensors. But I just remembered that you will be able to play Xbox games on your phone via Xcloud. Gyro aiming is also quite popular on phones and frankly I have no idea how you would even play a shooter on your phone without gyro.

So does that mean that you can use a controller that supports gyro and use it to play Xbox games via xcloud on your phone?

Could you possibly connect that controller to your Xbox and get the same gyro functionality when playing directly on your console?",0,0.42,4,2020-09-26 16:12:25

I am about to cancel my pre-order of an Xbox Series S,ApeGeek,"For the first time in my life, I took the decision to pre-order a console, without knowing if it was the right decision. As a broken student, budget is quite short and the Series S appeared as the best pick for me. No 4K TV at home, just a regular cheap Full HD / 60 HZ monitor (plus the fact that I am living abroad for the year so I don't have any monitor in my flat share -&gt; planning on playing games through console streaming) 

Yet, days are passing and the more I think of it, the more it sounds like an impulsive decision, made because of a lack of money. I already have an Xbox One SAD. And while Game Pass is a fantastic feature, even more nowadays, I can't ignore muddy graphics, poor framerate and technical limitations. Deep down, I want to experience true next-gen, I want to see what technology can offer at its best, I want to be amazed and captivated. 

£250 is quite an amount for me so I have to make the right decision. Should I maintain my pre-order, sticking at good ol' 1080p for a decent price ? Or is 4K gaming a genuine game changer that justify such a huge investment in a Series X ?",0,0.39,46,2020-09-26 15:03:25

Is the current Game Pass Ultimate price point sustainable?,chimpanyeezus,"Long time PlayStation fan here considering picking up an Xbox Series X with Game Pass Ultimate.

The one thing that scares me about Game Pass is whether the $15/month price point for GPU will stay at $15 for the foreseeable future, or will it slowly creep up?

I work in pricing and have had experience with SaaS pricing before. Usually subscription prices start at an unsustainable level and slowly creep up over time, yet the churn rate isn’t as bad since people slowly get walled into the ecosystem by then.

Do you guys think GPU price point will increase over the next few years? $15/month sounds very appealing to me right now, yet I can’t help but wonder what happens in 2-3+ years to the pricing.",12,0.79,30,2020-09-26 07:13:27

Haven't seen a lot of PC players that are jumping at this deal. Any thoughts? 

Only thing really pulling me to the PS5 is the playstation plus collection which would let me play a bunch of exclusives I missed out on.  4K gaming doesn't seem to be 'in' just yet in the PC community, so I'm assuming most people don't have 4K monitors and instead are aiming for 1440p 144hz rigs so the 4k ability of the PS5 is a bit hit or miss for me.",1,0.57,5,2020-09-26 07:11:33

Who Here Is Getting The Series X A Year Or Six Months Later From Launch?,MaximilienH,"IMO, I feel that the Series X is a console with great value and the recent MS acquisition of Bethesda has made me desire the Series X a lot more. However, I won't be getting it at launch and instead around the holidays next year. I feel that the main big reason is that the Series X is seeming like a console that will start to gain value later on in the console generation. Although upcoming games like Avowed, Hellblade 2, and the Bethesda acquisition (with the prospect of future Bethesda titles like Starfield and Fallout 5 being exclusive) has made me want the Series X, most of these games are probably coming out Q4 2021 at the earliest and the effects of the Bethesda acquisition will probably not be so relevant in the first two years of the generation. Because of this, the Series X **at launch** does not seem very appealing, but I think that it will possibly become the best value console when the main Xbox exclusives really start showing up midway in the generation. Although Gamepass undoubtedly has great value, it isn't appealing to me since I'm the sort of person who likes having games physically and also since I already own most games on Gamepass that appeal to me now. As of now, the Series X launch lineup looks less appealing than the PS5 one which has games that appeal to me like Spider-man and Demon's Souls (so I'll be getting the PS5 first since it offers better value to me now), but the Series X (with all the new studios and IP's Xbox has acquired, plus Phil Spencer at the helm) seems to be shaping up as the sleeping giant of the next-gen console generation thats poised to bring the best value and most likely some of the best games. I would like to know your thoughts and opinions on this (and if anyone is of similar opinion), and I'm excited to join you all on Xbox later next year.",0,0.44,31,2020-09-26 06:12:07

"Are there any versions of games that will only have the xb1 version? As in, no smart delivery?",go_go_gadget88,"After talking with my wife, we have decided that the XB approach to cross-gen games seems better in the sense there is only 1 disc to buy for the xb1's and the series. So we are going to use our XBSX for all the cross gen stuff, and the ps5 for the sony exclusives and online stuff.

My question is, are they ALL like this for now? Or are some going to be just xb1 versions and others will be only for series games? 

I ask because I'm looking into preordering AC Valhalla as something to play on the XB when it launches. Most places like gamestop, bby, target, etc, all seem to show a cover with the smart delivery logo on them, and say Xbox 1 / Xbox Series, leading me to think I could just get that 1 disk, and it would play at varying levels depending on if it was in the xb1, xb1x, or the series x.  However, walmart appears to be selling it for $10 less than the others, but the picture for that one looks like it is ONLY an xbox one game? So would that version not have any series x enhancement?

XSX with PC,pmo2408,"Will games optimized for XSX run better than a “high end” PC?

Towards the end of last generation, with the release of Destiny 2 on PC, I decided to build my own rig, 1080ti 8700k, runs games great with high frame rates (120 FPS at 1440p) and a high FOV.

I have been an Xbox gamer since the dawn of halo, but now I am questioning this upcoming generation. I have an X1X in home and have a XSX preordered currently.

Everyone says I don’t need an Xbox because everything I can get on PC. Problem is, Gamepass ultimate divides games between PC and console (like Doom Eternal coming up or how Red Dead Redemption 2 was only on Xbox Gamepass). They also enhance certain games for the X1X and will do so for XSX.

So should I keep the XSX preorder and sell my X1X? Sell both? Just want another perspective on maximizing value here going forward.

Xbox Series X/S Post Pre-order Megathread,BatMatt93,"Hey r/XboxSeriesX

It's been a crazy 48 hours since the Xbox Series X and S went on sale. Many victorious stories of people spamming the F5 key fast enough to get through and unfortunately sad stories of others being beaten by the dreaded web page error demon. Whichever way you look at it, emotions were all over the place.

We have been noticing a lot of posts coming up of people celebrating their pre-orders, noticing their pre-orders being cancelled, and others noticing some sites still having stock and wanting to share. So we figured it would be best to have a megathread for everyone to share all this information in one place. So any of these posts made outside of the megathread will be removed, it all must be put in here.

We would love to try and update this posts with links to sites, but with how quick they sell out we just wouldn't be fast enough so we'll be keeping the sorting by new as the default so people will hopefully be able to catch those type of posts. For those having their pre-orders cancelled, be sure to share it here and any solutions that you might have to help others so that they don't fall victim to it too if its possible to avoid happening. If the solutions are verified to work, I will update this megathread showing the solutions.

As always, if you guys have any suggestions on something to add to this megathread be sure to let us know in modmail.

Xbox how do you incentivize and put pressure on individual game developer studios to be better then everyone else under game pass? Where is the capitalist approach to win a market for a individual game when no one is buying a game directly with game pass?,OpticBlitz,"Assuming Gamepass becomes what a majority of Xbox users subscribe to, what puts pressure on a developer if a majority of their customers will be playing the game through game pass. A capitalist approach would be to compete with other game developers to win the customer but now if no one is paying directly for a game under game pass what drives or incentivizes a game developer to be better than everyone else? 

Also under a game pass type of ecosystem would that encourage game developers to utilize micro transactions because people won’t be buying the game directly?

My favorite game developer is Bethesda game studios. I would hate to see that studio become relaxed by not having to compete with say obsidian over customers dropping $60. Since no one is directly buying their game with game pass I fear it could decrease pressure to be better or more innovative than other rpg game developers. I just hope that Bethesda game studios will continue to push themselves and make amazing content better then the competition and not fall in the mindset of having a safety net “gamepass” incase they fail or don’t exceed expectation.",0,0.23,26,2020-09-25 08:26:16
Series X pre ordered. Keeping One X as secondary gaming console vs xCloud on phone.,HankScorpio20,"Already posted a similar post on here but would wanna gather more thoughts on this. So I was a PlayStation guy pretty much all generation. Got a One X in April in case I couldn't get a Series X and to make the move to Xbox already. Loved it and my PS4 Pro went unused for months. I always had the idea of selling my One X for the Series X but now I'm attached to it cuz it's amazing and it could still be handy for a few years. I'd use it on my 1080p tv in my bedroom and the Series X in the living room on the 4K.

The thing tempting me to trade it is that I'd pay around $30 for my Series X. I have a second kid due in April and I'd wanna save as much as I could for that. Without trading the One X, I'd pay $240 ish out of pocket for the console, controller, warranty and battery pack since I'm trading more things. So it could obviously save me money so kinda obvious what I should do.

BUT I wanna keep it for occasions I wanna be in the room when company is over. I could free up the living room and they could chill there instead of being in the kitchen all the time and I could be in the room left alone. Also like I said with a second kid on the way, I could use the One X for occasions I can't come to the living room and have to be in the room to help out. Baby can fall asleep and I'll play quietly for a bit. Also I would like to be in bed with my girls on lazy days and play.

The thing making me double think a console in the room is that I know when I can play, I'll wanna play on the big 4K. I've had consoles in the room before and I don't use them that much.

So with that being said, would I just be better off using an Xbox One controller and using xCloud for the occasional gaming in the room or should I just keep a console that was made for gaming and not streaming?",1,0.57,8,2020-09-25 08:25:30

"Xbox Series - S - It would be a great 1440p console, but...",Turbulent_Visual7764,"If you're sold on the idea of 1440p gaming? I wouldn't get too excited.

Xbox One - X has demonstrated that the level of 1440p support we receive, on the Xbox, is only as far as 1440p native display support.  The  majority of games, if any, DO NOT support / output 1440p. This has been a problem for 3 years now. Developers seldom choose to support 1440p...this is odd because the Xbox One - X  has a great and capable 1440p GPU and NEVER should have been forced into 4K.

Case-in-point? Consoles have always had this problem. With vendors refusing to believe that a LARGE part of the community runs standard PC monitors to game off of...and not necessarily 40-72 inch TVs (try easily getting one of these into a dorm)  with standardized timings and only a handful of resolutions (480, 720, 1080 and 4K resolution). So while you can definitely go into the Xbox settings and set your display to 1440p? Your games will still be forced to upscale 1080p to your 1440p display, which looks hella ugly, or VSR/ downsample 4K output onto 1440p, which does look nice. As far as native 1440p?

In a few years I think VR may be the only thing that saves console gaming.,muhname,"* Amazon Luna $30 Firestick, PC/Mac, Phone
* Google Stadia $30 Chromecast, PC/Mac, Mobile 
* Microsoft Xcloud 
* Nvidia GeForce Now
* Sony PSNow
* Apple Game Service

I get the objections to latency issues, library issues, etc. Here's why I don't think these will stop the sea change that is about to happen. 

The  biggest server companies in the world are now competing to deliver games as a service on streaming devices that encompass mobile, computer, smart TVs and dirt cheap streaming TV devices. They work with controllers from any game system and they cost $6-$15 a month. These services will be available to the masses. Amazon will promote on Twitch, FireTV. Google will promote on YouTube and Google TV devices. Apple will promote on Apple TV and iOS devices. 

The competition to improve the quality of these services over the next few years is going to be intense. 4K 120 will be possible and you will even see a teraflops race on the server side. Microsoft Xcloud is already one-upping Google's Stadia teraflops next year. 

I know it seems like this tech is far away still from console quality, but a competition has just started between the biggest tech/cloud companies in the world. The console wars of this generation will be a sidebar of the game streaming wars. This could be the last generation of consoles. 

The only hardware they sell that will matter will be the streaming stick and the controller. 

Beyond that what devices will require additional hardware? VR? Motion controllers? Cameras?

Indie games needs a bit more recognition,Gamermclord,"No rant no complaints. Just a bit of discussion.
So as a pc gamer with not so amazing specs (6th gen i7 Gtx1060) I fell in love with indie games. Not only are they cheap but I didn't need to care about graphics and frame rate issues. And so many choices. No loot boxes, DLCs, constant patches etc.. All in all indie games are amazing. Plus it's fascinating how many amazing games a small team or an individual can make. 

I am very pleased that xbox has something called ID@xbox and is supporting indie but still most of the indie games I see not many of them.. There are so many games like project Winter. Among trees and of course among us that must come to xbox.

I just wanna discuss the future of xbox towards indie games. Can we expect to see more freedom like steam? And I feel Microsoft store should also categorise indie games better. Many games are missing under indie. Many that are in gamepass doesn't appear in that list. And many big company games also appear under indie.

Any fellow pc gamers who are picking up Xbox Series X?,shinzra,"Hey all, 

So I primarily play on pc, have a pretty good pc setup (2080S), always been a fan of new tech and have owned each console now for couple of years when they come out.

Just wondering if any other pc gamers with decent setups are also picking up a series X, and if so, why?.

For me I think being able to switch to a more relaxed setting (couch etc) and playing on my bigger tv compared to monitor, for some games feels better.

Also mostly play sports games on the console for the bigger playerbase",16,0.73,38,2020-09-25 03:13:56

Microsoft is positioning the Xbox ecosystem in myriad ways to take fullest advantage of the emerging low cost high speed worldwide internet availability.

The goal of Microsoft is to have 1 billion+ gamers on a gaming subscription. Which is looking ever more doable. Also why they keep adding to their studio and gaming IP stable.

Meanwhile Sony is tightly focused on turning the PS5 into a profit making venture to the detriment of it's gaming base in other areas (restricted BC, not growing PS Now - basically eliminating as much as possible anything within it's own ecosystem which would distract PS5 owners from buying those $70 PS5 games).

This is true for today's Xbox One. I know that we won't have ""snap"", but this is true for the current version of the OS on Xbox One as well.

* HDMI In port
* IR receiver port
* Option to play non BC games from almost any external hard drive
* IR based media remotes of Xbox One won't work - as it is today we don't have alternative.
* Kinect and Kinect based games
* Might lose USB TV Tuner support - not sure about it
* Might lose OneGuide - not sure about it
* Volume/On-Off for TVs that don't support HDMI-CEC
* Series S **only** - option to play disc based games and movies (very few games are disc only, such as ""LEGO Dimensions"", so keep that in mind if you're playing these).

I tried to return to Xbox this upcoming gen,ProfBawbag,"UK folk who pre ordered from Smyths, or more to the point, those who pre ordered the Series X All Access package, have you had your order cancelled yet again? Seems a fair few folk have.

I initially ran into the now infamous  pre order fiasco that both Smyths and GAME had on Tuesday, where you got sent the Direct Debit and got a hard credit check on your credit file, but you couldn't check out.

Smyths then attempted to re launch the pre order scheme yesterday (Wednesday 23/09) and all seemed well again.  The order went through. Second hard credit check from the finance company involved, but i got the product and whilst annoyed, accepted it.  Today got a cancellation from Smyths because they seemed to have screwed up again.  So now, no pre order and a battered and bruised credit report with zero to show for it. 

I like many people swapped over to PS last gen for reasons we all know, so no point dragging that up, but after hearing MS/Xbox go on about their much hyped All Access package I decided to return to Xbox.  I wish I hadn't bought into their hype nor do I intend to return.  I've had less grief buying houses than pre ordering an inane piece of electrical equipment. 

I think my point is, MS should have had this bundle available on their own website rather than relying solely on the car crashes that are both GAME and Smyths. Their websites aren't fit for purpose. I'm not actually too bothered about not getting the console, but I do admit I'm salty asf about my credit file being trashed. MS have to take some responsibility for that. They chose the retailers, they chose the finance company and it was their much lauded finance package that have caused many people needless stress. Where the actual problem lies, I dunno.

I get it, I am but one person.  Won't make a difference if i buy one of their products or not, but needed to vent anyway.  Feel free to tell me how I should just sit back and stfu and accept it.",1,0.53,20,2020-09-25 00:06:29

PSA - You can get up to 3 years of gamepass ultimate for cheap,dwarrior,"With the new Series S/X coming out I'm not sure how many people already have game pass and I figured I'd share this little tip. But to start off this wont work if you already have gamepass ultimate and its only a $1 upgrade if you haven't already used the $1 trial.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently with Microsoft you can upgrade xbox live gold (up to 36 months) to gamepass ultimate for as little as $1. To do this you have to purchase 12 month xbox live gold cards from a retailer, I used Costco as it was $10/card cheaper. Once you have them add them to your account, once all your xbox live gold cards are added visit [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?#join) and sign up for the 1$ ultimate trial and your done! This automatically converts all your xbox live gold time into gamepass ultimate.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to note is as you are adding the xbox live gold cards to your account it will offer you free trials or bonus's for subscribing and such, decline them all. If you are already subscribed to gamepass ultimate instead of a 1:1 transfer, you will only get 1 month of ultimate for every 4 months from an xbox live gold card (so 12 months of gold only gives you 4 months of ultimate). However if your xbox ultimate subscription is a month to month you can simply cancel it and this will still work like normal ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: just to add this still works even if you've already used the gamepass $1 promo, as long as you dont have an active gamepass sub you can upgrade xbox live gold 1:1 but you will be charged for 1 month of gamepass instead of $1 (for me that was $16 cad).

&amp;#x200B;

For my US friends Gamivo is great for getting cheap cards if you want to go the 3rd part vendor route

Have You Been Thinking About Getting Both A PS5 and an Xbox Series X Too?,CompletelyInadequate,"Hello everyone!

With all this talk of gamepass, Xbox having the beast deal in gaming, all their first party studio games coming to gamepass, them buying Bethesda, smart delivery, awesome upfront backwards compatibility, and so on, I've been thinking about getting an Xbox Series X a little later down the road once there's more available everywhere and hopefully a price cut or some awesome bundle comes out. I already got my pre order in for the PS5 from PlayStation directly and I've had every PlayStation since the first one and I've never had an Xbox before only really played them at friend's houses when I was younger but more and more of this GamePass talk and upcoming exclusives have me thinking about inflicting myself with another $500 of damage, what do you think? Do you think it'll be worth it to have both consoles this generation? (the Series S doesn't feel next-gen enough for me I would want 4k and the better specs)

tl;dr - Do you think it'll be worth it to have both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X this generation? 

Edit: I also have a Nintendo Switch already too!",6,0.68,68,2020-09-24 22:50:42
I really hope the game clip system (especially in regards to editing) is completely overhauled for the XSX.,BeavingHeaver,"Don’t get me wrong, MS has made huge strides in terms of making the UI as fast and fluid as possible, however game clips seem to have been forgotten.

At the moment it’s a complete mess imo. Trimming clips is laggy, and when you are finished and it tries to render, it gets stuck at about 75% done, and just stays on an infinite load screen. I don’t understand how the world’s most powerful console’s system struggles to complete a very basic function. 

You also have game clip uploading to Xbox live which seems to take upwards of half an hour, sometimes longer in my experience. Surely this should be a matter of seconds, minutes at most. 

There is also Upload Studio which has not seen any updates in months. I really loved utilising that when it first came out but then they seemed to give up on it. 

It would be great if they could streamline this whole aspect more so it actually works in terms of editing and uploading. 
Everything else on the Series X|S looks amazing, so hopefully they show this area some love too.",1,0.57,5,2020-09-24 22:49:40

Did I make the right decision?,wesleycrushedit,"On an impulse, I dropped 699 (Singapore dollars) on the Xbox Series X pre-order. The retailer was running a promo with my credit card (25 bucks off plus a month of Xbox All Access). I was holding off on buying another console coz I just built a new PC in the hope of getting the next gen of graphics cards. But guys. Seriously the price delta is just no Bueno.

I dropped around a grand to build almost from the ground up (I had some leftover SATA SSDs, and an old GTX 970) and it's a great daily driver / straightforward 1080p gaming...

But honestly I think going Xbox was the right choice. The exclusives game is getting interesting with the Bethesda acquisition and even without it I think Microsoft's strategy is fundamentally different from PS5 or even playing on a PC, plus I have a 4K TV...

"Xbox has completely revived itself from the dead in the last two years, but it still has a small yet glaring issue",qwerty28112003," Idfk why even F2P games need Xbox live gold, I mean there's a reason they're called F2P games. And I don't know why Xbox is so petty that they're still locking F2P games behind a paywall. Now I don't have a Xbox one, I play on PC but I've seen Xbox locking games like apex or fortnite behind gold. This is just not good. I'm happy that they're offering a lot of value for their subscriptions. I believe that gamepass offers an insane value for 10-15$. I'm happy to play flight simulator 2020, the outer worlds, subnautica, Ori and Halo MCC using gamepass for my PC. And they're just giving us so much more by teaming up with EA play and giving us all Bethesda titles too on gamepass and offering us a mostly practical way of streaming games. But this doesn't change the fact that they're still locking games behind a paywall which even Sony or even greedy Nintendo gives you for free. This is honestly such a dick move and I don't think anyone benefits from it. I'll soon switch to a series X and I will pay for gamepass ultimate. It's very much worth the price for 10$. But please, Xbox, don't force me to pay you up! How much ever the value the gamepass offers, some people won't just be able to afford it. 10-15$ a month for a subscription isn't really cheap even in my eyes. Many people would consider it expensive, even considering the insane value it offers. And these people usually play f2p games too. Hell most people atleast play one f2p battleroyale now. But forcing these people to pay up isn't really effective at all. You're hardly going to extract money that way. You'll just make these people resent you. It Xbox/microsoft is rich enough to buy up one of the largest gaming studios in the industry for 7.5 billion $, can't they bear the cost of hosting some players on f2p games on their servers? This is just downright petty. I hope Xbox fixes this but I guess nobody will understand this post and call me some kind of Sony fanboy.",0,0.33,9,2020-09-24 13:16:49

How you can upgrade games to Xbox Series X|S with Smart Delivery,Ashaika,,36,0.83,1,2020-09-24 18:57:54
Why the Xbox Series S is fine,TrantaLocked,"Let's look at what the Series S actually is and the implications for game development.

The Series S has the same CPU as the Series X but at 200 Mhz lower frequency; a negligible difference. It has the same SSD speed. The RAM is half as fast with 6GB less capacity, and the GPU is about a third as powerful as the Series X. What I believe is actually going to happen is that games for Series X|S will be first designed around the Series X, with textures then down scaled and internal resolution lowered for the Series S version. This will not be a problem for developers. The engine runs on the CPU, and any SSD asset streaming will also be unaffected. The RAM and GPU bottlenecks can easily be accounted for by first lowering resolution of textures and internal resolution rendering, then lowering sampling level of effects, and then in the worst case scenario just setting a lower frame rate target for the S in case the target is 60 FPS or higher on the X.

I was originally thinking the memory performance parity will be a huge problem, but based on the information we know I've reasoned that Xbox games will *not* need to be built around the S as the baseline, rather may around the X, as scaling down for assets and resolution is quite easy compared to readjusting the entire game for a weaker CPU (which again is not the case here). People who buy the S knowing it's unprecedently cheap for a launch Xbox console will be ok with this situation; they know they were making a small sacrifice for a smaller and cheaper device. Xbox has shown it will have good value this generation. 

I wrote this post because I'm sure there are many of you like me who were nervous about the Series S situation, and not only it potentially holding back Xbox Series X but possibly the entire console generation. I firmly believe this will not be the case. Thanks!",0,0.4,23,2020-09-24 18:42:05

1. Maybe MS and Sony come to some sort of quid pro quo agreement, e.g. ""We'll give you Starfield if you give us XXX"" - this is inline with Phil's vision of opening gaming up to everyone. If Sony fully leverages the PS5's haptic controller, SSD and Tempest 3D so that the best playing experience for their 1st party games is on the PS5, they'll have less to worry about. I can kind of see this happening. Maybe they'll have Minimum Advertised prices, e.g. ""If I let you have this game you can only sell it for $##"" thus ensuring accessibility but a guaranteed cheaper price on their own platform. I really don't know. But if it happens I think it would be a win for MS.
2. Maybe timed exclusives for MS. The games will be on Xbox/GP then *maybe* allowed to PS5. I just don't see this happening though. I really don't see MS giving up their games just for cash. If so, why buy Zenimax in the first place? Why not just come to an agreement to always have their games on GP? MS bought ownership for a reason.
3. Sony/PS5 pays for access. Somewhat the inverse of timed exclusives. So instead of paying to have a game earlier than MS, Sony pays just to have any access at all. Again I don't see this happening, MS is not in this just for money. They're pursuing something grander.
4. MS shares nerfed / inferior game quality, e.g. 1080/1440p for PS5, 4k for Xbox. To me this is an interesting strategy. MS has already set the table with the Series S. Maybe they give the Series S versions to PS5 to fulfil the ""opening gaming up for everyone"" but keep the 4k to themselves and Game Pass. I'm not sure if Sony can do the same, i.e. offer nerfed versions of their exclusives. Or if they would even want to.

These were only my thoughts - I've no evidence either way and I'm also sure there are other scenarios. It would be interesting if Scenario 1 or 4 happens though.

What do you all think will happen?",0,0.5,28,2020-09-24 17:56:46
Series S memory,kingh29,"Hello, so I have a Series S on pre-order and I just wanted to make sure I am right about the memory situation. From what I understand, I can use any USB 3.1 storage device to hold any games not designed for the Series S and play them from the hard drive. However, if I want to be able to have extra storage for new games, it has to be on the console or on the Seagate SSD hard drive? My plan is to keep any new games that come out on the console and then older ones from Games Pass on an external hard drive. I just wanted to check that if I got say, an old COD game, it would not count as a next gen game if I get it on the console, so I could store it and play it from the USB 3.1 hard drive?

Probability of Obsidian doing a Fallout game.,ParticularLong5887,"If you look at the current games in development it gives some clues. 

We know Bethesda is working on Starfield and TES6 after that, so a generous time frame for those would be 5 years I would guess.

Phil Spencer - the best thing to happen to Xbox since Halo,honkyjesuseternal,"Just a few weeks ago, people were calling for his job. Phil Spencer has shifted focus not only for Xbox, but Microsoft, and has put in place a plan for the next 5-8 years. 

When he took over for the disgraced Don Mattrick, Xbox was in shambles. They knew they had to get rid of Kinect, and in the process take away their whole plan for the past years. They took the in-game tumor that was Kinect and erased it. They worked on things like Xbox back compatibility and made it a reality. They didn't completely buy in the doomed VR phases of the game industry. They shied away from spending money on ""exclusive content"" as that would bring more trouble.

What they did do is acquire and put some love into several more studios, create the best value in gaming in Game Pass, and create good will with their consumer base who just wanted great games on a great ecosystem/platform. The future is bright because of Phil, and while he did axe projects because they were dead in the water he also made Crackdown 3 happen, which is a game I really enjoyed almost as much as the first. He also has put money and his own stature at Microsoft on the bet of a better Xbox. The one many of us are trying to preorder with no luck.

I remember a post on here stating if within 30 days you don’t get the product then Citizen One I run your credit again. That’s not what I was told and it was confirmed to me by a supervisor. 

I’m sure All Access will be worked out by then and we’ll be able to get the product if we are already approved. If not then the credit drop should be gone by then if I’m not mistaken. 

Either way this is decent news.

How does the Xbox store and Ultimate work?,Keegan934,"Hi everyone.

Yesterday I preordered the Series S since it was the most logical purchase to go with the pre order I made for the PS5. It will be my first time trying Xbox (also a reason I bought the Series S and not the X) and I'm quite excited but I have two questions since all I've had in my life are Playstation and Nintendo consoles.

1- How does the store works in terms of regions? I'm used to Playstation's regional stores where the USA has one store, Mexico another, EU another and so on. Is this the same with Xbox? Or how does the store work?

2- How does the pay $1 to convert gold to ultimate work? I've seen many people talk about it and I'm confused. Let's say I buy 3 months of gold and activate it when I get my Series S and I can just pay $1 to convert those 3 gold months into ultimate ones?

Thanks in advance.",2,0.75,3,2020-09-24 04:08:59

Preorder Credit Card Question,breakngbad,"Sorry if this question has already been answered. 

I was wondering if anyone had any knowledge of if Microsoft (where I preordered my Xbox series x from) would outright cancel a preorder if the credit card I put on there declined. When I say declined, it doesn’t mean I don’t have the credit (I have more than enough) but sometimes Capital One will decline my credit card if I charged an expensive order and will text me to make sure I was the one that bought that and not a scammer.

Once I text back yes, they say to try to pay again and it won’t get declined the next time. This has happened once when I bought a $250 tv from target.

Anyone know if Microsoft will reach out or outright cancel the preorder if this happens? Or know what to do? I called Capital One and they basically said they don’t know if fraud detection will happen but if it does to call them when it happens (not helpful I know).",5,0.85,6,2020-09-24 03:41:05

Who else with a failed All Access preorder just got a Citizens One alert about their new line of credit?,FOR_WORK123,"Absolute fucking disaster lol. 

I tried to grab a Series X on Gamestop yesterday via All Access (since it would be more convenient for me to space out the payments instead of paying all at once). I was under the assumption that a certain number of consoles were being held separately, so that people would have enough time to get through the credit line application and grab a preorder. 

I successfully completed the Citizens One credit line application but, after getting approved by Citizens One, hit the ""SORRY WE'RE OUT OF STOCK NOW!"" error on Gamestop and thus didn't get my All Access preorder in. An hour or so later, Citizen One's credit check shows up as a hard pull on Equifax, which is irritating considering it didn't actually serve a purpose. 

Today, I've now received an email from Citizens One that my line of credit is **active ($2,500 lol)** and my online portal is ready for activation. I just got off the phone with Citizens One customer service who claim the account will be deactivated in 30 days and allege the account deactivation won't hurt my credit score, but still — this fuckin sucks!

KEY TAKEAWAYS  
Do not try to order an Xbox with the All Access program if there's any risk of consoles going out of stock during the process. I imagine this risk will persist for the remainder of preorders and holiday shopping. (And avoid applying for a payment plans for any electronic devices, because getting a line of credit for one product alone involves risks like this and is also unfortunately kind of dumb)",22,0.86,38,2020-09-24 03:22:48

Xbox Gamepass business model - How do publishers monetize the service?,klipseracer,"I know the details are locked down but I've seen some of them leak out. My understanding is that there is a lump sum for agreeing to bring your game to the service, at least for some titles. And then afterward, I'm guessing there is a chunk of the total revenue which is divided up among the titles which are listed in game pass and that is paid out based on play hours. Since the revenue comes in on a monthly basis, it makes sense to me they would go this route.

I like this because its really a performance based situation, if you put a massive title like COD in there and tons of people play it, they get the lions share of the money. Maybe not as much as releasing it stand alone but you also get the chance to acquire new customers you wouldn't have had otherwise which has positive secondary benefits.

If you are a small indie who happens to put out a really awesome game, you get rewarded with huge money.  It would seem to me that companies would stand to gain by letting people know their title is in Gamepass to increase their play hours. With Microsoft's shift to active users and play time metrics, it seems to fall in line with expectations.

But in the case of the Xbox, it is costing much more.

Are there different controllers?,Samurai_Predator,"I am just curious if there will be any official releases of any controllers that are a different style rather than the standard one? I ask because I have both consoles now but just don't play enough of the Xbox because I'm not a fan of their big controllers, I prefer the smaller playstation one because it feels more comfortable. So now, with the new news, I'll be getting both consoles again but want to play the Xbox more. So will there be any official controllers that are different from the original or will I have to find a secondary source and hope it connects to the Xbox and doesn't mess anything up and works right.

Is this a good monitor for Destiny 2 PVP on the new Xbox Series X?,DaveB585,"First post on this thread so apologies if I'm breaking any rules.

I'm looking to purchase a new monitor for:

* Xbox Series X (no PC)
* I just use a regular Xbox controller (no mouse and keyboard)
* I only play Destiny 2 (might play the new Halo in the future)
* I really only care about speed and performance (visual aesthetics and graphics not so much).

I'm not very good when it comes to this stuff, but I've heard 1ms and 144hz are really the biggest things to focus on for competitive FPS performance on console?  If so, I was thinking this could be a good monitor for competitive Destiny 2 on the new Xbox Series X?

It's very clear what Microsoft is trying to do here and it is going to pay off big time.,Jutang13,"The most powerful next gen console on the market. For the hardcore gamer and enthusiast and for those who want to make the most out of their high resolution and refresh rate displays.

The most affodable next gen console on the market. Good option for those on a budget, wanting to get a second console, casual gamers, and those looking to buy a family console or for their kid/s. 

Xbox Game Pass. The netflix of gaming. Gives consumers access to a huge library of third party games and day 1 access to first party releases for an incredibly affordable price.

Xcloud. Tapping into the mobile market. Giving access to an enormous line-up of third party and first party library of games for an affordable price and able to be played on mobile and tablet devices. Xbox is also committed to bring this to iOS.

23 first party studios. They are deticated to publishing many high budget and quality first party games that will sell consoles, and/or gamepass. And they have expressed that they may purchase more studios too.

PC support. Releasing first party games on PC, and offering gamepass on PC, along with amazing consumer friendly programs like play anywhere, cross-progression, and cross-play support expands the ecosystem to PC gamers.

Adaptive controller. Expands accessibility to gaming to people with disabilities. 

Multi-gen backwards compatibility. Makes it easier to move on to subsequent generation consoles and retain game libraries and purchases from past generations. Makes it easier and more affordable to keep gamers engaged and loyal to the ecosystem. 

Accessory compatibility. Similar to the above, makes it easier and more affordable to upgrade to subsequent generation, allowing consumers to bring forward most of their accessories rather than being forced to buy new products.

Conclusion - It is very clear what Xbox is trying to achieve and, in a way, it started with the xbox one but that was implemented and executed poorly. Phil Spencer and his team has definitely managed to turn it around and execute what has clearly been Microsoft's vision for the future... and that is catering to and covering every corner of the gaming industry as a whole. 

There are over 2 billion gamers in the world. While many outlets have declared victory in the past based on how many consoles a company has sold, consoles alone only reach a fraction of the gaming population as a whole. Microsoft realises this and is using its financial power to not only expand it's reach, but do so aggressively at every level. 

Ive heard people say Sony is primarily trying to sell consoles and Microsoft is primarily trying to sell gamepass. That's simply wrong. They have both the most powerful and most affordable consoles on the market along with 23 first party studios. Microsoft is primarily trying to sell everything: consoles, gamepass, xcloud, games. 

They have a long term strategy and it's going to pay off big time. 

Sony will be fine this generation, but they don't seem to be prepared for what Microsoft is going to achieve over the course of the next 10+ years.",34,0.83,10,2020-09-23 23:06:50

Why I feel it’s smarter to start with Xbox for this generation,Laeeq117,"I’ve been heavily considering both the Xbox and PS5 for a while now. I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, the Xbox is simply the better console to start with for this generation and that I’ll likely pick up a PS5 much later on. Here’s why. 

Game Pass Ultimate presents an amazing bang for your buck. Why pay $10 a month for PS+ to simply play online when you can pay $15 to play online, have access to all first party exclusives on day one without having to purchase them, and be able to play games on the go with Xcloud? 

With the Series X, you can also play all of your multi platform games at the highest console fidelity. I don’t see the point in playing them on the PS5 especially when cross play is starting to become standard. The argument of playing with your friends on a specific platform will eventually become void. 

The PS5 has some absolutely amazing first party exclusive games. There’s no doubt about that. However, most of these are single player, story driven games. In my case, I’d play through them thoroughly enough one time and hardly ever touch them again. I couldn’t justify paying full price for these games. It makes more sense to wait for a mid generation console refresh, pick up a PS5 slim, and then snatch these games for $20-30 with all the patches and DLCs bundled. 

These are my thoughts on the two consoles. Id love to see your opinions or any other points you’d like to add.",32,0.8,37,2020-09-23 22:53:29

I have a bias towards Xbox for the memories and experiences over the past 20+ years. Please help me build some hype for the Series X launch day as I am underwhelmed and don't want to be..🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,darth666bane666,"I love the Xbox brand. I moved over from my teens on PlayStation to Xbox and have loved everything about the brand since. I've kept up with the other consoles, Switch Ps3/4. But my Xboxes have been the consoles I have had to have day 1. I have the day edition Xbox phat, I have a day one S and a scorpio edition X. But something about the Series X feels more akin to the scorpio upgrade than a new generation. Which is fine, I get the strategy to keep the UI standardised across generations and even games being cross gen really doesn't bother me. But the features and launch package just aren't there for me. 
My Day one Xbox launch bundle was:

Assassins creed black flag.

Dead rising 3.

Cod Ghosts

Ryse son of rome

Zoo tycoon.


Along side this I got new features like voice commands, snap, TV throughput etc. It was an exciting day, full of surprises. Some Good, some really wonky! But it was there.

Now I am looking at Assassins creed Valhalla. Thats all. No new features. I have yet to be shown how Ray tracing and load times are actually implemented. I saw a video of load times from outer worlds, thats it. Unless I upgrade my TV I won't get anything over 60frames, and 120 will be limited to indie side scrollers mostly anyway. My X runs everything it can in 4k hdr, that will be the same. And we've yet to be shown how hdr will work being applied to every title. 

I don't want to come off as Xbox bashing, far from it. I love gamespass, i love how gamer focused Xbox vision is. I love the recent Bethesda acquisition and really like the look of the games they've got in the pipe. But its just that launch day feel. I know I'm going to hook the series x up and log in and not really feel anything different to if I was logging in on the scorpio.

Anything I should know? (New to Xbox),P05eiiiidxn,"I’m switching to Xbox this generation. I’ve been with PlayStation since the ps1 and always said I’d never get an Xbox. 

Until 2 days ago when I changed my mind and decided to preorder an Xbox Series X.

Is there anything I should know as a newcomer to the Xbox community? And any advice? Like should I get game pass?

Also if anyone else has switched from PS to Xbox I’d love to know how the two compare.

Xbox Series X on eBay,bearmoosewolf,"I got my pre-order in for an Xbox Series X (not without the pain we all probably felt ... Best Buy, Microsoft, Target, I'm looking at you...).

Anyway, I've been watching eBay auctions for the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5 just for the fun of it and, in general, there's a consistent price point for the auctions (\~$850 for an Xbox Series X, \~$800 for a Playstation 5). But, then there are these auctions where the exact same Xbox Series X or Playstation 5 Disc Edition are bid up to $2000. Anyone knowledgeable about eBay auctions that understands why this occurs?

They are the exception certainly but there are a bunch of them. I mean, there will be 20 auctions where the Xbox Series X will for $800-850 and sprinkled throughout there will be 3 or 4 that are bid up to $2200 or even $4000. I don't get it.

**Edit:** And, before anyone asks, no, I'm not checking eBay because I'm interested in selling my pre-order. I'm just curious about demand for the consoles.",1,0.67,13,2020-09-23 22:35:24

Appreciation post from India to Microsoft for paying attention to us.,sonuyosrox,"I live in India, and last-gen was a mess, Xbox release 1yr after the worldwide release, and PS4 released 6 months after the release.

But this time everything has been changed, currently, we do not even have confirmed pricing for PS5 in our country, no preorder or anything as well and it is already pushed back from worldwide release date, but on the flip side, Xbox has announced the price, started and ended the preorder (sold out in 10mins flat) via digitally &amp; local retailers (local retailers selling console is a big deal as it is not a norm here). And We have the same release date as world wide (which makes us in line with Australia &amp; NZ, somewhat 15hours before the worldwide release).

It's just feels so good that gamers in India are finally being paid attention to and being treated same as all the other places. I have successfully secured a preorder for X as well via a local retailer.

Again Thanks a ton Microsoft for making it possible. &lt;3",380,0.95,87,2020-09-23 21:14:04

I got to my local GameStop at 6:00AM, and there were already 8 people there, who got there anywhere from midnight to half an hour before me. Lucky enough, the sign on the door showed 7 Xs and 2 Ss, and it worked out so that everyone got the console they wanted. 

Everyone was just so positive, and we had a fun time chatting about our favorite Xbox games and memories, and how excited we were for the new generation and the Bethesda deal. One guy even bought Chick-fil-a breakfast for everyone there with all his CFA rewards points! You just don’t find people like that in every fanbase. 

And even the fans who we had to turn away who came after me were super nice about it. Sure, they were bummed, but no one tried to pull any cheap moves or got angry; we all just wished them luck in trying another store.

Game Pass makes it so review scores no longer matter.,welcomethrillh0,"I’ll preface this by saying yes, I’m sure reviews don’t matter to a good chunk of people.

I have always been someone who loves reviews. I love getting different opinions on something to direct my purchases for any game.

If a game gets a sub-80 Metacritic, I’ll always be hesitant to sink in 
money and time into something that mightn’t be up to scruff.

What Xbox have done with Game Pass is completely eliminate this fear for me. I can make my own opinions on a game without it hurting my wallet, &amp; if I’m not keen on it I can just bounce.

If I think something looks even remotely for me, I can give it a try, no hassle.

Recently played Sunset Overdrive, and after an hour or two just decided it wasn’t my jam and swerved it off. &amp; I didn’t have to feel bad about spending money.

The other week I preordered a PS5, but don’t think I can justify one at the minute with all the negatives PlayStation are coming up with at the minute, so I think an upgrade from my Xbox One X to a Series X is definitely on the cards.

After seeing the posts about how scarce the numbers were, I got worried.  I took my lunch at 4AM and decided to check out my store for numbers and if a line started yet (work is a few minute drive to my GameStop).  Pulled in and found a lone shivering soul sitting on the ground, Rusty had been there since 2AM.  The door said 5x and 1s, ugh.  Talked to my fellow die hard Xbox fan for a few minutes till I had to leave back for work.  Told him I’d be back around 7AM.  As I was walking back to my car, I looked back to Rusty sitting on the cold ground and remembered I had my chairs in the car.  So I pulled out the two chairs I had and gave them to him to use. Told him hopefully I’d be back in time to get a spot, and to let someone use the other chair if they needed it. As I was pulling out, Rusty waived me down. He told me his mom was coming to sit with him and save my spot till I got back.  I was absolutely overjoyed!  I had a spot in line and didn’t have to spend the rest of my shift in a near panic.  I went back to the store straight after work, low and behold I count 6 people waiting for the 6 consoles.  I get out of my car, Rusty’s mom jumps up from the second spot in line and gives it to me.

Does it matter what HDMI cable we use for the Series X?,nineninetyfive,"I'm not much of a display person and with my current setup I want to buy a 10-15ft HDMI cable since the ones that come with the console are probably not going to be long enough.

This just confuses me but some of what I've read says that refresh rate doesn't matter at all for the cable (and that HDMI only supports 60hz?), and that anything above is handled by the display.

So is it as long as it's an HDMI 2.0/2.1 and high speed it should all work the same? If I happen to have a 4K TV with a refresh rate of 120Hz, and as long as the Series X is capable of running the game at 120fps at 4K, it's perfectly fine?",1,1.0,10,2020-09-23 14:35:31

It was a miracle,HagPuppy89,"First of all, I’m sorry for anyone who did NOT get an XSX or XSS. My condolences, and I can empathize with the feeling. 

At any rate, I have to tell this story about my awesome wife. She isn’t really a gamer, and her use of the Xbox is mostly TV streaming related. So her interest is mostly to help me get the new Xbox, because she knows I want one.

First of all we both got ready early to head to a physical GameStop store and got there at about 6am PST. There were a few people in line already and it looked like a fair amount of them were “together”. And  so, we figured we would probably still snag one.

After waiting for almost 2 hours the GS employee handed out the claim Numbers for the XSX and XSS (7 and 2 respectively).  The people that were “together” ALL got one, 7 in a row. 

My wife and I were there together but only were going to get 1, so I guess we thought they were the same... we thought wrong! So it was 7:45 PST, and we scrambled our butts to our car and sat there waiting for the online sales to go live.

8:00 came, I had the BestBuy app open (with my card info already pre-loaded) and my wife pulled up Target’s website... refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh... in the cart, Waaaaiiiiit... OUT OF STOCK, on Target.

BestBuy’s didn’t seem to go live until well after 9:00AM PST. By this time we were both already at work and I work in the field and my wife at a desk. Well, after checking BestBuy periodically, it finally went live at around 9:25AM. Refresh, refresh, refresh, add to cart, refresh, checkout, refresh, refresh, place order.... place order... place order (repeat infinitely)

OUT OF STOCK.

(As it turns out both my wife and I, separately, were both on BestBuy’s site trying to get one and both failed.)

Welp, seemed like our last chance had run out. It’s okay because there’ll be more pre-order drops and it’s honestly not the end of the world. We were pretty bummed anyways.

1 hour 30 mins later, it’s 11AM. I had long forgotten the failure of the morning and had gotten on with work. I get a phone call from my wife, which isn’t unusual as she calls me for work often (family business). She says

Her:  “Who do you love?”

Me: trying not to be hopeful “what’s going on?”

Her: “I got a Xbox from BestBuy!

Me: “No way! How?”

Her: “I just figured I’d check again, maybe someone’s payment didn’t go through and we could still snag one, and it must’ve worked!”

#Cue #Celebration

TLDR; we thought we missed our opportunity to get an XSX and through some fluke my wife gets one at nearly 11AM PST on BestBuy’s website. Best Wife ever.",25,0.79,33,2020-09-23 12:20:15

Xbox Account Stolen and Used to pre-Order Xbox Series X,Sperla95,Yeah so my e-mail was hacked and my Xbox account was stolen from me.

Unfortunately they used my account to pre-order the new Xbox Series X using one of my credit cards. I called all my Debit and Credit cards companies and cancelled all my cards. I also reset every password that I could find. I was never charged for the pre-order on my credit card because they charge pre-orders when they ship.

Leveraging exclusives with Bethesda acquisition,CarlosOchoa98,"Tldr: it'd be great if Xbox used the Bethesda acquisition to leverage PlayStation games to be on Xbox as well.

I know this is probably really unrealistic, but with all the questions right now about the Bethesda acquisition and wether future games will be exclusives or stay multiplat, I think there's a third option I'd like even more.

Phil Spencer and the team at Xbox have said that exclusives are not really something they try to do, but maybe because they are a business or maybe because Sony pushes that narrative with PlayStation, they are being forced to play that game (maybe both tbh).

And PS fanboys (not fans in general, I mean the toxic fanbase specifically) all of a sudden changed from ""Xbox has no games!"" to ""please Xbox, let us play your games!"" or something else to downplay this move.

Well, what if with the acquisition, instead of going with either of the two options of being exclusives or being multiplats, they talked to Sony and said something like ""hey, you can still have these games on your platform if you bring God of War and Spiderman to Xbox"" (just to name some PS exclusives, I'm sure everyone has different preferences). That way not only do they stand by their words of not liking exclusives, but also negotiate with the rival company to stop doing it! Aaand it could be great for the players, everyone could play whatever they wanted in whichever console they wanted, and the selling point for consoles would be to actually be better (the console, the services, etc) instead of this game of screwing the competition by taking games away from them.

Like I said at the beginning, it's probably extremely unrealistic, but one can only dream! And I'd love to play the two games mentioned, but I don't want to buy a whole other console just for two games, and I prefer gaming on Xbox.

Anyway, what do you think? Even if this is crazy to talk about, would you like this to happen? Or should everything stay the way it is?",1,0.6,5,2020-09-23 08:05:45

Has Microsoft said anything about improving controller QA next-gen?,Illuvial,"Title says it all. Out of the 6 controllers we have between my partner, my roommate and myself all 6 have had issues. 4 of them had the headphone jack jostle out of place so that headphones can't connect anymore, one of those 3 is an Elite Series 1. 1 of them has a broken RB that occurred after just 5-6 months of use, its an Elite Series 2. The last one has had the left analog stick screw up in some way that has caused it to have massive input delay when inputting up and down, most of the time it fails to register vertical inputs at all.

Other folks I know with Xbox Ones have had similar issues with controllers.

Its beyond frustrating. I love Game Pass, I love the controller when compared to the Dualshock 4, I just want to play my Xbox. Its to the point where I got a converter cable that lets me use my Xbox controllers on my PS4.

But they just keep breaking. No matter how good of care I take of my stuff, they always break. I've never had this issue with a system before. Been using the dame Dualshock 3 for 8 years, the same Xbox 360 controller for 9 years and the same two Dualshock 4s for 5 years.

Why won’t you buy my Xbox One X? Why must I go to GameStop to trade-in my Xbox One X for credit toward the purchase of an Xbox Series X? Don’t you want me to buy directly through you? Wouldn’t that benefit you more than GameStop getting my $$$? Isn’t that return and exchange data valuable to you?

Am I wrong in assuming there are enough gamers who would rather trade-in their current generation hardware for credit toward the next generation to make it an equitable trade-off for you to administrate? If you don’t have the retail space, and see too many challenges in remote returns, couldn’t you partner with a more global series of brick and mortars to essentially act as your middleman? How am I supposed to believe the company commentary of your belief in the value of my Xbox One X when you won’t even buy the thing back from me at a reduced value for the purpose of staying in your ecosystem to give you continued value?

Billions of dollars in Game Pass Ultimate Subscriptions.,red-ransom,"With 15 million subscribers, Microsoft brings in 225 million dollars each month off GPU subscribers. Which is roughly 2.7 billion dollars a year. If that number continues to increase, as it shall, the incentive for Microsoft is to continue to make bigger deals to bring more ground breaking games to game pass bringing in more subscribers and revenue. Console sales will follow. And it’s win win for both consumers and producers. What a brilliant business plan, I feel as though it will really take off from this point forward. Comparing to Sony’s model of charging 70 dollars for 1st party games, it will be a lot cheaper to play Xbox game studios 1st party games than Sony’s through GPU. Sony does have excellent games, but who knows if they will continue at that caliber, Xbox sure is not staying silent nor passive.

It’s not about consoles now, it’s about how many GPU subscribers they can bring in.",4,0.62,10,2020-09-23 05:02:48

Answers from CitizenOne for those who were approved but couldn't buy,One_Half_Hamster,"I just got off the phone with CitizenOne and this is the information I was given. I recommend you also all call as this deals with your credit, but wanted everyone to be in the know.

I was approved for this through the Microsoft Store.


1. If you were approved, a line of credit now exists for you in the amount that you would have owed. You do not currently owe anything on this.


2. If no action is taken in 150 days, this line of credit will be closed.


3. A hard inquiry was placed on your credit for this approval. It will remain on your credit for 2 years.


4. (I dont think this one is correct, but im only reporting what I was directly told from the representative.) If you do not get it from the retailer you were approved by, another hard inquiry will occur at the time of getting approved by that retailer.


5. (I also don't think this is correct) The original retailer may cause another hard inquiry if you have not made your order in 30 days.


Overall, incredibly frustrating. There should have been some way to help prevent this on Microsofts part when dealing with consumers credit, even if that way was to not allow people to attempt to pre-order. Im mostly mad at myself, because in hindsight it should have been obvious this may happen.

I re-iterate, I recommend that you call CitizensOne yourself and record the date, time, and name of your representative in case you need to dispute anything on your credit. This is meant only to provide some much needed clarity on what happened to those of us who were approved for credit we weren't able to use.",22,0.84,15,2020-09-23 04:48:10

The problem isn't the fact people sell their xbox series x on ebay. The problem is the fact that idiots are willing to pay for it.,i_am_legend26,"So if you didn't got your pre order for the xbox series x just please wait a month before you buy it fron a stranger on ebay. A month is probably the maximum to wait I think. 

But if you do buy it on ebay you show that the console is worth more. This is also happening with new rtx 3080. People online are buying an rtx 3080 for a max of 2500 dollars. People that buy it for that much are the reason that the next rtx card will coat even more because nvidea knows how much some people will pay for it. 

The same goes with everyother pre order in the world. So i want to adjust to everyone, if you are buying a xbox series x and than sell it to make profit your an asshole. If you buy it from someone for more than its worth than your a fucking dumbass. 

If you want it so badly please just wait a month its not like your going to remember that first month and be like omg know that month i got the new xbox when some people didn't that was amazingg. Thats not going to be the case, just wait a little bit.

Is a Series X overkill for a 1080p display?,[deleted],"Sorry if this is a silly question but I'm not sure where to find the answer.

I'm usually a PS guy but Xbox has really got their shit together since last gen and I'm very impressed. Thinking I'll double dip this gen and get in on that sweet gamepass action.

My question is; I only have a 1080p tv which I am perfectly happy with, is it a waste of money to go for the X over the S? I'd rather have that extra storage but then all the rest of the hardware will probably be overkill for my display. At the same time slightly concerned how the lower powered S hardware will hold up in several years time.

"Best Buy is having a cart problem, here is a way around it!",3DeltaNerd,"I couldn't for the life of me get it to work on my account so I did this:

1. On your phone, log out of your account in any browsers and the app if you have it.
2. Open chrome app and go to the site, then ""Request desktop site"" in chrome by clicking the bottom right setting button and scroll down.
3. Keep hitting the pre-order button until it adds to cart.
4. When you go to cart and check out NOW sign in to your account.
5. Win!

There is a key difference between the ""Due to high volume"" error and the ""There was a problem adding your product to cart."" errors.  It didn't like that I was logged in and I think their database still thinks my account had the item in cart from earlier at launch.  

I bet this is why they re-opened the orders.

So... I just ordered my very first Xbox...,raybreezer,"I'm excited right now! I have been a self-proclaimed Sony-only enthusiast since my original PSX. I have always been partial to the exclusive games that were on PS and because of that, I had only ever come close to pre-ordering the 360 at EB Games years ago, only to convert it to a credit towards a PS game right before release.

I have always had a growing library of Xbox games at the back of my head that I would want to play one day, and I told myself that if the Next-Gen Xbox was backward compatible, I'd purchase both systems this gen. Having missed my shot at a PS5, I was determined to not make that mistake today. I'm happy to say that I have the confirmation from Microsoft that my Series X order was successful!

So here is where I need some help. I have never owned an Xbox, but I am vaguely familiar with a few things I may need. For one thing, I know the controller's are usually not rechargeable. Meanwhile, I have always had a charging stand for my controllers from the PS3 days. What do seasoned Xbox owners recommend? Are there other accessories I should be aware of?

While we are at it, any must-play games you recommend? Definitely interested in couch co-op style games in addition to single-player as my wife and I game on occasion. I do prefer to own physical copies of games, but I intend to subscribe to game pass in order to dive into some of the older games in my wishlist.

Looking forward to being a part of the Xbox family.

Edit:

I appreciate the conversations everyone has been having with me. If anyone else is about to reply, I am also curious about the ability to use headphones to play without sound coming from the TV. On PS, there's an audio jack on every controller, but I don't know if that is the case with Xbox.",25,0.93,74,2020-09-23 02:18:42
MS has to make changes to Bethesda in order for this acquisition to benefit us greatly.,HeroFlamez1,"We all know at this point that MS acquired ZeniMax and now has everything Bethesda-related. However, Bethesda was originally going to release everything on Xbox, so that means that unless everything Bethesda-related gets some sort of improvement, it doesn't do much outside of the fact that everything's gonna be on Game Pass permanently and that Playstation won't have Bethesda titles anymore.

To be fair Bethesda has put a good chunk of their stuff from the past few years on Game Pass, it just was a period of time after the games launched and they stayed for 1 year

\-Make sure Bethesda games don't have predatory microtransactions. I guess fairly-priced cosmetics are fine, but they should be unlockable through playing the game.

\-Make sure studios are given enough time to fix bugs and add a good amount of content, but also try to make sure studios are using time efficiently

\-Make sure all Bethesda games look up to par. This is mainly an issue for the main Bethesda dev team, the others like iD and Arkane should be fine in this department. The engine overhauls to Starfield and ES6 after this announcement are absolutely a step in the right direction

\-Have Bethesda completely abandon their launcher on PC and put their games on Steam. Sorry if I'm not up to date and they have already abandoned it.

\-Take over marketing, Bethesda have proven they're incredibly incompetent at this with Fallout76. I'm not saying MS is a huge improvement, but there's only one way to go after Fallout76 and that's up.

I know they said that Bethesda will be the same studio and doing the same things, but I really hope that's not true because there's a lot that could happen to improve Bethesda.",3,0.72,4,2020-09-23 02:13:03

Seems like all access isnt actually intended for what some(🙋‍♂️) think it is.,nick3308,"Not salty or anything like that but, hear me out. 

I kind of think part of the reason they promoted all access so heavily was because of covid and people maybe not being able to afford the entire cost of a console during the holiday this year. That being said, it still seems you need a 700+ credit score to be approved. I mean, I got a $140K loan for a house last year and have a credit in the mid 600s. 3 and a half years straight of on time payments. No derogatory remarks. No hard inquiries since last year when I was getting a loan for my house. And still failed to pre qualify.

It doesnt always go hand in hand but, if you've got a 700+score,  statistics will probably show you're more likely to be able to afford the console outright than you are with a lower score. Of course they're not just going to give a loan to anyone but, I figured 650ish would be high enough. RIP to my dreams haha. I'll just have to try and snag one before christmas.",7,0.71,13,2020-09-23 02:09:21

I didn't get a confirmation email and there did not appear to be anything in my order history for Gamestop/Microsoft; however, I do have two pending charges for $0 from gamestop and one for $0 from Microsoft.

Please don't feed the Scalpers.,PeterTheWolf76,"So I like a LOT of players didn't manage to get the console for release day however if I wanted to play 900$ or more, there is ebay.

That said no console is worth that and if we all unite against this behavior we all win. PS, Xbox and Nintendo have the issue because it works for people. They dont love the games, they just want fast $$ at the expense of those who do love the games.

There will be more consoles made and eventually we all will get one so please dont feel the scalpers as it just makes it harder for us all.

*EDIT*  slight update as I tried best buys app one last time and got lucky!  My stance still doesn't change though in that we should just wait if you cant get one.  Patience seems to pay off.",236,0.94,118,2020-09-23 00:52:32
"Got a pre-order, but I am nervous about cancellation.",HumpbackHippo,"So I was on and ready all morning. I had every single possible retailer opened on my account and target app on my phone and by 10 I was off to the races. For about 10 minutes it was just a shit show. Website lagged for me and 4 consoles instantly was put into my cart and by the time i got them out it wasn't letting me order. Long story short by 10:11 I was finally able to purchase my pre order of the series x on target. My thing is I read a lot about target being known for cancelling pre orders due to overselling and such things like that. I tried pre ordering on amazon, but I fumbled that one and also tried to pre order on best buy and got to right as i confirm everything and purchase and it wouldn't let me and after 5 minutes it kicked me out. That happened twice. I'm now sure that i'm just gonna have to hope for the best with the one from target. WHY IM MOSTLY SCARED THOUGH is that I had a promo on my account i was gonna use for something else in my cart that was 10% off anything in my cart excluding things like Xbox one hardware, ps4 hardware, Sony electronics ect. on top of that target is doing an extra 5% along with the normal 5% when using your red card right now which means I got my xbox series X for a full 20% off. I'm nervous that this is gonna fuck me and make me lose my preorder. Sorry for overtyping i'm just very nervous and hope this doesn't screw me. Does anyone have any advice or anything? thanks and I hope everyone was able to snag one !",5,0.65,8,2020-09-23 00:51:52

"As someone who has secured both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X, neither 'process' was better than the other.",ChrisCohenTV,"Yes, Sony's 'SURPRISE!' pre order tactic was incredibly infuriating to those that weren't preemptively refreshing pages just in case they dropped the pre order after their online showcase, but the staggered retailers showing up here and there, with little warning at different times was actually conducive to sites staying stable and folks who were attempting to get one not succumbing to Web based issues.  

Microsoft's 'Everyone go to these sites at this exact time!' approach went exactly how we expected it. Sites buckled under the sheer weight of traffic, consoles didn't appear on every site at the same time anyway (some here in the UK still haven't gone live), confirmation emails have gone missing, delivery methods have been botched and as a result, most of those who took every possible precaution to make sure they were in place to order one at 8am this morning, have still been left not knowing if they will get one for launch.  

Both methods were flawed. Nothing was put in place by individual sites to combat the weight of traffic, to make queueing fair or to prevent bots. I know these events don't come around often but surely, in 2020, there must be a better way to go about things than this.  

For me, the best method was ShopTo.net. They prioritised pre-orders based on when you registered your interest in the product. Even that's not perfect but its a start.  

Did you get one? How was the experience for you? I managed to get one by chance on Amazon at 8:15am when they inexplicably appeared suddenly. The whole thing was exhausting and stressful.",60,0.69,103,2020-09-23 00:27:09

We all knew this would happen. Sorry if you didn't get your preorder because you fought against hundreds of thousands like yourselves!,MadMikeLove,"I was refreshing for 55 minutes on best buy and Amazon and honestly i probably just won a timing lottery on hitting f5. I was able to get one on amazon. If you did the same and couldn't get one, that sucks, and I know the feeling. I collect vinyl records and certain records I'd kill for sell out within 10 seconds. Can't even get the payment info straight before they're all gone. Feels very unfair, and save for bots and resellers, it mostly is fair. Gotta remember, MOST people buying these consoles want them to play them.

What if Microsoft made Sports games instead of CANCEROUS EA And 2K?,StunningBowler,"Just a point to ponder. EA and 2K are so cancerous with each game title being the same, with just a roster update every year and adding more and more F\*\*ng ridiculous micro-transactions in their games.

Why can't Microsoft go down that route in making their own sports franchises? They have the power and the money to buy all the licenses? If Microsoft can get Fifa and Madden, make the games more polished and publish it without any micro-transactions, I can guarantee MILLIONS of people will instantly jump on Xbox Game Pass.

So the question is, why aren't they? Instead of spending $7.5bn on a publisher that charges $100 a year for a broken ass subscription model for Fallout 76, why not go down a different route? 

Please don't defend Bethesda or Microsoft and why the deal made sense etc. Keep the answers relevant to why can't they publish sport titles?",0,0.4,3,2020-09-22 16:23:53
